because he had run out to try to find me
because he thought I was driving away
and I got out there and caught him in the act of looking for me
and also being out in the front+yard where he is not suposed to be
so he said
I think he was really lying basically
he wasnt doing pee pee on the grass

where is the other one 
oh here it is
what was that nam 
what you found

i am going to take off your pants
so it looked like he was building it up out of the units
 do not take off
and then wha
 do not take off my pants
and then he kind of readjusted because he like it better with the
	idea that off would follow pants
 so do not take my pants off
he likes that better
so he kind of correct him self essentially to that
and I was cleaning his nose a+lot this morning and trying to fix
	him up
he was having a+lot of problems

oh well first we have to get the pajamas on then we can go look for
	it ok 
here stand up hey you have a picture of nam and nam on your
	pillow
right there nam and nam
right
right
here you go
dirty nam

well maybe we can look at one more book before you go to bed
what 
right
yeah
there is no talking on this tape this tape is empty still
see we are talking into it right now so then therell be talking on
	it did you get your hair cut 
at your home 
at your doorhome 
what is that 
uhhuh do you want me to open your window 
you see what 
nam 
gargon 
gargon

oh and what is the son name 
nam 
oh see that is not very loud is it 
that is not very loud now we can back up
when we see that car move out
yeah that is a back seat
mhm I have a big back seat
your mommy and daddy cars do not have a very big back seat they
	just have a little back seat
but mine has lots of room in it people can even sit in it
sure is bumpy here
 bump your mommy called me just before I came here and she said
	oh I forgot to put nam car seat with him this morning so when you
	bring him home hell just have to sit in the car regularly with the
	normal seatbelt and I said well that is how he always sits in the car
	because remember last time you were in my car 
you just had on a seatbelt you werent in a carseat remember that 
 were just sitting like this 
yeah here we go
going to nam house
oh but see we cant go to my house because they are cleaning it
	everything being cleaned so you cant walk on the floors because
	they are all wet and uh it is just being cleaned but maybe next week
	we can go to my house ok 
when yeah when it is the when it is ok to go there see right now
	...
everybody really busy
and they are all trying to fix up the house
what 
yeah later
you have Cheddar cheese on your face

it is cold 
it is kind of hot actually it is a little bit cold
yeah
that is right that is right it is got holes in it so it can talk
what 
that is right
why is it going 
because whenever you make a noise if it is a loud noise then that
	little needle picks it up it goes back and forth
that can hear what you are saying so when you talk it moves and when
	you do not talk it doesnt
yeah
and see if we do not say anything then it wont move or if it was
	really quiet then it wouldnt move but if there is any noise then it
	moves back and forth
cause it can hear the noise

it is a special building
it is a what is it 
a tower on+top+of a church

well he is holding up the little the little hammer like this guy
but he is a statue
do you know what a statue is 
it cant move right 
it cant move at all
right those are people
those are normal people
he can move
he can move
see this little what is that 
right a little dog
yeah
who is she 
she is holding a book
right 
I wonder why she is holding a book
do you know why she is holding a book 
why do you think she is holding a book 
huh 
because she is thinking about her son
maybe he wrote the book
she had one son in nam who was studying reptiles
these are the reptiles
then what happened one day 
what is she doing 
she is going oh hello mr Post_man
look what you brought me
what did he bring her 
right she screamed
why did she scream 
look it
what did she do here 
she knocked over the candles
yeah
she was surprised
why did she scream 
yeah
who sent her the snake 
the man 
what man 
no he brought it to her
that is the postman
he brought it to her but you know who sent it to her 
who gave this box to the postman 
her son back in a this guy back in nam
see he was looking at all the snakes in nam so he decided to
	send one to his mother
oh it was her birthday present
she didnt get a cake
she got a snake
 birthday snake
to make sure it was not a poisonous snake she went to the zoo
she identified it as a boa constrictor
so what did she call him 
right
that is a crocodile
do you know what a crocodile is 
a fox 
he does look a little bit like a fox doesnt he 
he has this long snout and all these teeth
but they are different
a crocodile is is more like a fish
and a fox is more like a dog
oh look it
he has a wooden leg
hmm
what is he doing 
he is getting the snake 
he is trying to get the snake 
but there is a glass window so he cant get it right 
he cant reach in to get the snake
he wouldnt want to get the snake anyway
probably wasnt a very friendly snake
like nam
right
right
and he doesnt want to get him right 
his hands are behind his back
he doesnt want to reach in and get the crocodile
yeah
that is because he is too little
he doesnt know what he is doing
you are not supposed..
 to reach in and get snakes
right
except he is not tall enough
right
why..
why why is he putting his hands behind his back 
grass 
oh glass right
he cant reach through the glass that is right
yes
they do not want the crocodile to get out
so they put a glass window in front of him
holes in it 
no I do not think there is going to be any holes in the glass
he cant get out
pretty hard to make holes in in glass
what is she doing here 
right
because he is a little baby
give milk to little babies in bottles
nam mothered her new pet feeding it bottles of milk
there is a mouse
under the what 
the couch 
under the couch
do you have mice under your couches here 
no

they just have mice in nam
she brought palm trees so nam would really feel at home
they have little marks on him
yeah
you know why 
why 
counting him yeah
she wants to see how long he is
so she is measuring how long nam is
so she puts the little numbers on him so she can see with this
	ruler here
well fed nam grew longer and longer and stronger and stronger
you know what he is doing here 
what is he doing here 
right bringing palm trees for nam
that is so hell feel happy
that is a police+officer
that is a french police+officer
and he is stopping all the traffic
he says to the cars
 see this man is driving a car he says do not go
 you cant go because that lady and her snake are crossing the
	street
 so you cant go
see..
 they are very slow
they cross the street very slowly
so they have to stop the cars
right
cars are coming so they are trying to cross the street as fast as
	they can
but they cant go very fast
she is kind of old and nam is such a long snake you know
he is so long it takes him a long time to get across
yeah she is pulling nam
on a little leash
she doesnt really pull him
she just kind of leads him
right to help him along
and what is he doing for her 
is he carrying something for her 
what is he carrying 
a little present that she bought
what do you think it is 
yeah

I was complaining about its use in in uh literature
and frank did not understand what I was talking about
i am going to help him find his thing
I think it is on his dresser
he thought he thought I meant that all those ideas were not
	relevant
but all I meant was that it was all a very..
misunderstanding of the concept
the use of of..
mhm
a true idea for which there is a physical law is physics but not a
	law in..
mhm
 in other things
we were going to ah bring this into the kitchen

right
it is all tied to the tractor
then what do you do 
can you catch it 
it is already attached to the tractor is not it 
your toolbox 
did you here it is
it is closed already I think
well try inside
I do not know where I put this
that is where
here
yeah
damn 
you put oh no 
here
what are you doing now 
what are you doing 
want me to connect the ah..
bolt..
 to the little cube 
they are not the same threads
they do not go together
you do not..
what might..
 go together though 
I think this one hmm yes
I think this goes together with this
attaching
now we need one of these
here you go
need a hammer 
 what do I do with this 
mhm
what is that now 
what 
that is a nut
and that is the bolt
that is a bolt right
no that is a ah screw
that is a bolt
that is a good place
watch watch
let me show you
see how it is hanging in the air all by itself 
leave it down 
ok
why 
leave it in the air 
you mean make it stand up in air 
that is quite a machine
did you attach those yourself 
what are you doing with it 
there is not any more place to attach anything
well there is no more nuts
cept the one in the car..
 far away
that is a bolt
you need a nut
you need more nuts like this otherwise you cant attach it
on the other side 
mhm
I think weve used them all up
that is all the nuts
it is um..
ok
there is some inside on the floor ah as you open the door by the
	front seat in the little no nooky there
it is blue
what thing 
ok
here we go
ok
where is mommy say it was 
remember where she said it was 
here
where 
what is this 
well..
uh I found it
right here
got it 
you found that nut 
was there a bolt out there too or just a nut 
you can do it
you were doing very well
yes it does
yes it does
yes it does
look
now you do it
now you do it and i will help you
you do it and i will help you
put those two together
put this through and hold your hand on the bottom
ok
now attach the nut
what are you doing with the nut 
how you do it 
you turn it
there you go
there is no more nuts
we are all out
no more nuts
that is a different set
it doesnt it is not the same threads as the as the other ones
if you try to take one from the other places the whole thing will
	fall apart
well we can um..
add on
we can add on right
you can always add on something
i am attaching a couple more of these sticks so we can finish it off
	.
then go finish our breakfast which is really the main thing on my
	mind
reluctant as I am to enjoy breakfast
yeah I know how much you hate breakfast
this is a bit early in the morning for a major construction effort
	.
you are getting pretty good at that nam
those arent those are different
you cant put those two together
I told you
they are different threads
we should put that red one away someplace else because it really
	doesnt belong with those others
I know
that one doesnt fit
you can put it with your blocks and stuff
well it goes with this green one and this little red..
mhm
mhm
probably not with the green ones
but it is too confusing
it must be the same kind of set but a different..
I think we done did it
you used every one
let us see if we can get this up in the air a little bit
the balloons are helping a+lot
yes
they are holding it up
goodness
that deserves a snapshot
it is not going to stay long together long enough so we can have
	snapshot
I think it will stand on its own two feet briefly
if you balance it right
no
too heavy on that side

it is hot
I used the last grain of gumbo filet powder
you mean the thing so we cant put any on ah..

blew it
all of it
would have made more sense to leave it out
then we could have added it
well there was only about a teaspoon in the whole bottle
yeah
that is right
that is why it would have made more sense to leave it out
because then you could have added the teaspoon to our servings which
	would intensify the flavor
and then we could have gotten a little more
oh
I didnt give you any chicken did I 
that is good
you can blow it yourself little nam
that is right
you can have your chicken after you have some some of that
sure
can I have the pepper for my xxx 
well nam
what did you do at nam house

busy 
busy is different from dizzy
nice to go over to nam house because you can try out all the
	new toys that there are
what about puzzles 
did you work any puzzles 
what kinds 
hmm 
what kind of puzzle did you work there 
was there any special one that you liked 
best 
which one did you like best 
the bus one
mhm
uhhuh
you put it together very quickly
it was nice to watch
it was fun to watch you putting the bus puzzle together
you did it really very nicely
mhm
very fast
all the big people were amazed
did daddy say that 
oh yeah 
and then did you change it 
did you change it after daddy said that 
or did you just leave it 
it ended up pretty much right
so you know what happened nam 
you started out doing it and you did it very well
and you had about half of it done perfectly
and then one or two pieces ended up in a funny place and made the
	rest of it quite hard to do
so that is when I said that you should move those other pieces
	around a little bit
and did you play with nam and nam 
let us talk about nam house a little bit too
whatd you do at nam house 
when I when I left you were playing with some legos werent you 
little tiny ones I saw at his house

what else did the house have 
windows without shutters and windows with shutters 
did nam also have a kind of a workbench with plastic tools 
what kind of tools did he have 
firetrucks 
is that a tool 
I was thinking of that little bench with the vice on it and the
	hammer
remember that 
what other tools were there on that bench 
there was a drill I think
was there a drill 
a clamp 
I just ate a hot pepper
oh no
drink some more beer
wow
fortunately fortunately you do not have taste buds in your stomach
oh
that is hot
mommy said that when she came to pick you up you went falling on
	the ground and hurt your head
is that true 
how did that happen 
there was a van coming 
and so why did you fall on your head 
because you wanted your daddy 
didnt you want your daddy after you fell on your head 
the question is why did you fall on your head in the first place 
did you think that would make your daddy come 
I think somebody pushed you
somebody pushed you 
did somebody push you 
oh good
no 
well
oh who pushed you 
nam and nam were in nam room 
where was nam 
a van in their room 
did you have a good time at nam house pretty much 
because when I left to go to work you said I do not want to stay here
	daddy
remember 
was that was ok though 
then after daddy left did you have a good time 
you didnt have a good time 
you werent playing with the kids 
we thought that youd have fun with them
right after I left didnt nam and nam come 
hmm 
at nam house yeah
mhm
mhm
I left to go to work
I almost didnt have to go to work
that is true
where do you think daddy we went 
yes he did
mhm
not only did I go to work but I stayed there all day  eight
	oclock
and the only thing I had to eat all day was an apple turnover at
	four oclock
oh
uh
and mommy thinks that I should feel sorry for her who had three
	square meals today
wow
pretty good apple turnover
it came out of the um machine and went klunk and bounced twice
klunk
it wasnt bad for something that came out of a machini
could have been worse
does this mean that you do not have to work on that thing any more 
oh we do not have to work on this particular proposal much any more
	.
right
oh tomorrow right 
you know I also sort of think that if I do not get a a an offer from
	Berkeley i am not going to work much on any of those things any more

 I will not leave you fall
 I will hold you up high as I stand on a ball
 with a book on one hand and a cup on my hat
 and that is not all I can do said the cat
maybe you could help me read this story 
why did they what 
what do you mean 
oh I see what you mean
like that 
like that 
like what 
oh because they are so surprised
because the cat in the hat is doing some strange tricks
look at all these things he has
he says
 I can hold up two books and a cake
are you sleepy 
ok
 look at me said the cat with a cup and a cake on+top+of my hat
 I can hold up two books
 I can hold up the fish
 and a little toy ship and some milk on a dish
 and look
 I can hop up and down on the ball
 but that is not all
 oh no
 that is not all
 look at me
 look at me
 look at me now
 it is fun to have fun but you have to know how
 I can hold up the cup and the milk and the cake
 I can hold up these books and the fish on the rake
 I can hold the toy ship and a little toy man
 and look
 with my tail I can hold a red fan
 I can fan with one hand as I hop on the ball
 but that is not all
 oh no that is not all
 that is what the cat said when he fell on his head
 he came down with a bump from up there on the ball and nam and
	I we saw all the things fall
because he slipped on the ball and he dropped them all
right 
ok
 and our fish came down too and fell into a pot
 he said do I like this 
 and no I do not
 this is not a good game said our fish as he lit
 no I do not like it not one little bit
 now look what you did said the fish to the cat
 now look at this house
 now look at this look at that
 you sank our toy ship
 sank it deep in the cake
 you shook up our house and you bent our new rake
 you should not be here when your mother is not
 so get out of this house said the fish in the pot
oh look at all these things that he did
he bent the rake
spilled the milk
 but I like to be here
 oh I like it a+lot said the cat in the hat to the fish in the pot
	.
 I will not go away
 I do not wish to go
 and so said the cat in the hat so so so I will show you another
	good game that I know
 and then he ran out
 and then fast as a fox the cat in the hat came back in with a box
	.
 a big red wood box
 now look at this trick said the cat
 take a look
 then he got up on+top+of the tip of his head
 I call this game fun in a box said the cat
 in this box are two things I will show to you now
 you will like these two things said the cat with a bow
 I will pick up the book
 you will see something new
 two things and I call them Thing One and Thing Two
 these things will not bite you
 they want to have fun
 get out of the box Thing Two and Thing One
 then they ran to us fast
 they said how do you do 
 would you like to shake hands with Thing One and Thing Two 
would you like to shake hands with Thing One and Thing Two 
why 
oh

 I will pick up the book
 you will see something new
on this is Thing One and Thing Two
weve already talked about them
you can turn the page now
ok
 nam and I did not know what to do
 so we had to shake hands with Thing One and Thing Two
 we shook their hands but our fish said no no
 these things should not be in the house
 make them go
what would you do if they were in your house 
huh 
would you tell them to get out 
and say get out Thing One and Thing Two 
and what if they didnt get out 
then what would you do 
then they couldnt come back in
so turn the page
 have no fear little fish said the cat in the hat
 these things are good things
 and he gave them a pat
 they are tame oh so tame
 they have come here to play
 they will give you some fun on this wet wet wet day
you turn the page
 now here is a game that they like said the cat
 they like to fly kites said the cat in the hat
 no not in the house said the fish in the pot
 they should not fly kites in the house
 they should not
 oh the things they will bump
 the things they will hit
 then nam and I saw them run down the hall
 we saw those two things bump their kites on the wall
 bump thump thump bump bump thump thump thump down the hall in the
	wall
what is happening here 
huh 
everything falling apart
what is their mommy going to say 
Hhh 
what would your mommy say if she came in and saw everything all
	messed up and fallen apart 
would she be mad 
let me take a drink of coffee here
mm
ok
turn the page
oh you turned two pages
no that is ok
 then those things ran about with big jumps bumps and kicks
oh you missed that page 
here
turn back to it
 Thing Two and Thing One they ran up they ran down
 on the string of one kite we saw mother new gown
 her gown with the dots that are pink white and red
 then we saw one kite bump on the head of her bed
uh+oh
look it
they have Mother new dress on the line of the kites
think she is going to be very happy about that 
no 
in fact she might get pretty mad and spank them
 then those things ran about with big bumps jumps and kicks and
	with hops and big thumps and all kinds of bad tricks
 and I said I do not like the way that they play
 if mother could see this oh what would she say 
that is right
what else would she say though 
and what else 
would she tell them to clean it up 
she would 
mm
nam
I have something on my coat
I think it is something that we had in our tortillas
mm
yeah
i will have to take it off later
ok next page
 then..
take this stuff off my coat 
take the coat off 
because i am cold now
I want to keep it on
oh no
 then the fish said look 
 look 
 here mother is on her way home
 oh what will she do to us 
 what will she say 
 oh she will not like it to find us this way
uh+oh
 do something fast 
 said the fish
 do you hear 
 I saw your mother your mother is near
 as fast as you can think of something to do
 you will have to get rid of Thing One and Thing Two
uh+oh
 so as fast as I could I went after my net
 I said with my net I could get them I bet
 I bet with my net I could ge those things yet
oh
so he caught the two things
 and told the cat in the hat take those two things away
 oh nam said the cat you did not like our game
 oh nam
 what a shame
 then he shut up the things in the box with a hook and the cat
	went away with a sad kind of look
 that is good said the fish
 he is gone
 yes
 but your mother will come
 she will find this big mess
 and this mess is so big so deep and so tall we can not pick it up
	.
 there is no way at all
 and then who was back in the house 
 why the cat

 and so I will show you another good trick that I know
what is this

 Then we saw him pick up all the things that were down
 he picked up the cake and the rake and the gown the milk and the
	strings and the books and the dish and the fan and the cup and the
	ship and the fish
 and he put them away
 and he said that is that
 and then he was gone with a tip of his hat
 and then their mother came in and said you two did you have any
	fun

sitting on the world 
why is he doing that 
she is sitting on a little chair
see that mask 
that is a mask that you can hold up to your face
and no+one will know who you are
 one special summer day nam Hippopotamus was taking a
	bubblebath in her river
 she scrubbed with the scrubbrush
 she washed with the wash cloth
 but suddently the slippery sloap soap split suddenly the slippery
	soap slid out of her pink paw and swam away with the fish
why did it do that 
why did her soap slip away 
it was very bad 
it ran away because it was very bad
 so she hunted for that runaway soap but instead of the soap she
	found..
guess what 
a bottle
what is so special about this bottle 
what did she find inside the bottle that was so special 
letters
a piece of paper with letters on it
 mouse come quick
 someone sent us a letter in a bottle
 no not a letter a note
 no not a note half a note
 Aad here is what that half a note said go far far away
 look very very hard and youll find when you roam the most
	wonderful
 right there the half a note stopped
what does that mean 
crash 
why does it mean crash 
first nam+and+mouse went up to Alaska
oo there near the north pole where nam lives they found
	houses made of igloos kayaks and snow flakes fat as mice
do you want her to sit on my lap again 
nam i will put you on my lap
that way you will not get in trouble
and nam can sit here
my favorite nam
 Alaska just could not be the most wonderful
 so they went to nam
 saw all the fish
 but the fish wouldnt play with nam or the mouse
 they gobbled up all the fish candy nam had brought as a
	present and they turned up their no fish noses and scittered away
whoops
 so they went to look elsewhere for the most wonderful
 they visited the great west of the nam
and here is what they saw teepees and indians and feather
	headdresses prairies and mountains and hot painted deserts
 let us go away they said
 this is not the..

 off they went to Niagara Falls the biggest waterfall in America
	or nam
here i will let her down on the floor again
here you go nam
why do not you get down
ok
 and the sights they saw
 but nam and the mouse didnt want a world that was all made
	of water
 so they decided they better journey someplace else to find the
	most wonderful
 they crossed the big Atlantic Ocean to nam and they went
	straight up to nam to look at the queen
 but first they saw the nam bridge Picadilly Circus and Big Ben
	.
that is a clock
 and finally when the queen rode past nam cried the queen is
	the most wonderful
 but no the mouse said
 the queen gone away
 the most wonderful wont ever go away
 go away that is one way well know what is the most wonderful
