she sometime really do talk 
I'm trying to think um lot of people name people that we see
um 
more animal and animal sound uh 
she say ball and she say ball for balloon and um she says
dog kitty duck 
uh she does not say cow but she say moo and you know the the
appropriate sound 
for some of those cat and a dog and a chick 
come here nam 
and cheese 
and hot 
well I think she had hot before 
um juice 
she use cheese when she open the refrigerator door and see it 
she say cheese cheese 
and uh and juice 
she say 
and baba 
those important thing 
only the block and the doll and the stuffed dog 
well book 
she ha a+lot of book 
and she can say book too 
she ca not say telephone 
but um she say hi 
she does not zip and unzip 
we do not practice that 
I mean I that nam 
we do not have that and she not encouraged to tie and untie 
ye it for sassy 
we call it a sassy I do not even know why we do 
let me put your shoe on 
uh I gues she could 
I just we just do not 
I do not have any I do not have that toy 
I have something with a zipper but I just do not play with it with
her 
right 
well I double knot them but I I do not know 
I just we do not play with her shoe 
oh pretty aware um we have some animal book 
mostly dog and cat but getting to chick and duck and pig and
goat and we had a thing we did with the camel and she recognizes
the camel know 
I have no idea what a camel say but we decided that a camel says
It just stick it tongue out 
and whenever I say there a camel she start to smile cause she
think it ridiculou when I make that sound 
so um we have those animal and um yeah and a turtle and a fish
we have in book 
yeah and we call squirrel kitty but just because she see them
out the window and think they are kitty not I think squirrel's
pretty hard to say 
yeah um yeah um we have of+course nam ha a multitude of
brushe around the house and comb 
she like to comb her own hair and she will comb some animal that
we have too I mean the real animal and and the toy like this here

well we have a hamster 
actually I'm after a puppy right now 
yeah but more entranced with this than with anything else she
played with 
probably les 
she wa in a stage then and we got her a phone and she played with
it then for a couple of month and now not too much at all 
but she did like the pushbutton phone 
ok nam 
we do not have a pushbutton phone at home 
at home I 
 mostly I just point and say what that 
uh I gues I'm thinking about it now 
I do not really say can you say 
I do not really say that I gues a often a I said it here 
uh I wa really aware that she was not saying anything 
uh but that why 
she really did say more than she did last time 
I ca not tell you how much more verbal she i at home 
she doing thing like this 
she exploring the whole house 
it she never confined 
it ismpossible 
um I do not usually ask her what she want she usually show me 
but that wa a situation of her being up here and it being on the
floor 
but if I say What do you want she'll go get it 
but um 
um she might if it wa a dog 
because I really thought she wanted the dog 
yeah dog she could say 
and I think that wa what I wa trying to get her to to say or
block She can say 
but I thought maybe she would say it isf she could not reach it but
she much she really more physical than verbal 
all this throwing and everything 
yeah she really i 
I mean she would much more I mean she would much rather throw
these than look at the thing on them 
you know what now I mean or uh book she'll look at but uh a lot
of real physical running around falling down 
uh she ha a similar one with thing to touch and look at yeah 
she did 
she put her finger through the hole yeah

third one until nam put the second one on the windowsill also
