he was saying 
nam you were saying nam are too big

he has them on 
he has them on and he says

the rest of the reasoning

his assumption is that if he can walk around in them

once in a galay far far far far far far far far far away 
uhhuh 
there once was a pilot and a copilot 
uhuh 
named nam and Chew and nam 
yeah 
there we were out they were out 
trying to see who had to take a  pilot 
mm for a ride somewhere 
nam 
once in a bar there are some gangsters pushed Han around but Han
just blasted them 
m 
they were dead 
yeah that was violent 
i know 
the guys who bugged the um the um monsters who bugged Han and Chewy
d
do you know who those guys worked for 
nam 
mhm 
and once the two jurey  the a  lung young lad named Luke
nam came into the bar 
ok 
well he came in a sand speeder 
mhm 
and nam the old de 
i mean um 
the old desert hermit 
the old desert hermit came with him 
he had taught gave him a light saber and taught him half of the
force 
mhm 
but they came with two nam too 
and they had to leave them out of the bar because they could have
been damaged 
mhm 
and there were no nam allowed in the bar 
that is right 
in the cantina 
yeah 
eature cantina 
and when they came into this little place with a table and Han with
nam were there 
mhm 
and they asked if they could go to Alderon in their ship 
mhm 
and Han and nam said 
sure but it will cost you plenty 
zzz 
yeah so what happened 
hey came they went but by accident when they flew off stormtroopers
knocked out their their engine and they could not steer it 
right 
i am changing a little bit 
yeah that is that is true 
and they 
did they make the jump in hyperspace 
um they had to put on a forcefield so if they crashed they would
like bounce away 
mhm 
mhm 
and when they soon came near Alderon they could not believe what
they saw 
Alderon was destroyed 
been blasted to pieces 
there was an asteroid where it was blasted 
mhm 
that is right 
then near it was the nam 
they were being sucked in 
mhm 
right 
then when  they were in this the Lord Darth and his captive um
Empire checked the um the ship 
mhm 
but there was no passengers they were hiding in the compartments 
special compartment yeah 
yeah 
and when one stormtrooper came nam opened his lid and threw
em down and knocked his stuffed his fist in his mouth 
mhm 
and went r  and nam knocked him out 
and he closed his lid 
and he  and he gave the suit to nam 
mhm 
and  Han was in there too 
right 
and so nam open his lid again and got another stormtrooper and
knocked him out 
and closed the lid and gave the thing to Han 
and then they and then nam got out the hatch 
mhm 
mhm 
and he was with the switch with invisopower and he turned on invis
invisopower so he could get through 
mhm 
and he tried to um turn um tried to like free nam 
mhm 
um by accident she was caught with nam 
yes 
and um meanwhile nam and Han pretend they got some chains like
ndcuffs and put them wristbands 
mhm 
mhm 
and um put them on nam 
and they pretended that they were taking a prisoner down to see
nam 
right 
and by accident some or well  they were trapped 
in a part of the nam yeah 
yeah 
they  and stormtroopers kept shooting across 
but they got nam free did not they 
no um not yet 
i am not making it not yet 
oh yeah right 
i am making it not yet i mean 
you are getting there 
and then 
but then when they shot they shot nam 
he was dead 
no 
i am making it up 
oh ok 
oh poor nam 
and when and they had to heal his skin n he i e was left stay so
they well nam had a little well um an firstaid kit from home 
mhm 
and he had some bandaid and he they taped up his skin 
pulled out the bullet 
yeah no it was an arrow 
it was an arrow uhhuh 
shooting out of the gun 
a laser arrow 
yeah 
yeah uhhuh 
and um well then they went on and by accident they were caught
between nam and his group 
mhm 
and they found a hatch and when they ran they slipped into it 
they went like nyeer and they dropped into where nam was 
mhm 
so then they got her free and when the stormtroopers were blasting
at them they had the  nam shot a door through the wall and they
swang into a garbage dump 
hmm 
when the garbage dump kept closing nam was pulled under by a worm
d
hmm jeez 
he was almost killed 
ok let us take a break now ok 
no i am still sppose to go 
you want to get to the end 
mhm 
ok 
and um when they shot at that worm they had to get the walls from
closing 
mhm 
so they found this big metal bar but it crushed the bar 
mhm 
so they had to contact nam um um R_two_D_two and C_three_P_O and
they freed them 
how did they do it 
well first they touched B_one and  that stopped the um walls from
closing and sucked the worm under 
mhm 
no um Three_D sucked the worm under 
mhm 
so and then um R_two_D_two and C_three_P_O threw down a rope and
tied it to someplace and they climbed up 
mhm 
and then they got to the Falcon 
and meanwhile nam and nam were fighting 
mhm 
and Darth     flang up his sword light saber and so did um
nam 
and then by well nam damaged um Darth i mean Vader 
mhm 
and then Vader  threw his light saber into his clothes 
mhm 
hmm 
and he and then he  there was nothing left when he shattered
down but his clothes 
yeah right 
and um they were still running to the ship and when they got out
they had to fight these um uh things 
mhm 
um ships 
nam got four hundred and um  Han got nine thousand 
mhm 
so um they went they broke the time barrier 
right 
if they were going to get out of there 
ok 
you want to take a break now 
because there is a+lot more nam 
when they got down to where the rest of the base was they had to
plan their attack against the Empire 
uhhuh 
when and nam volunteered for an X_wing 0 when they were fighting
against the Empire 
um nam blasted nine thousand hundred 
mhm 
and the other guys were blown up 
mhm 
and then Darth it was between um nam and nam 
and nam let go 
mhm 
and one sarge he said 
what is happening to you 
nam i i am fine 
and um Han flew down and the Darth blasted at him 
then Han flew down and he put on his um shield 
so and Han got out of there 
mhm 
so um nam could fire his dynamite so they went bzoom and blasted
nam ship 
mhm 
he had a parachute of+course 
mhm 
and um  um then when they got back

i will draw it 
i will show you what  what it is 
and he went back and he wrote m h i a b b i 
and i said 
oh it is uh mhiabbi 
and he said yeah whatever 
and he said and he wanted  and he took it to nam and he said
look mom it is a mobby 
uh i mean mhiabbi 
at what is interesting about this is that he he is a little bit
earlier he was saying what is uh s e r b y s and i said it is a
serbys and what is uh g o n k u r and this is a gonkur and he kept on
spelling random letter combinations and i had to pronounce them 
a+lot of them were unpronounceable 
and he seems to have gotten the idea that you can just  &ts
throw letters together and some how and some how they will make a word
d
this is very much like uh when he was a little baby he used to sort
of make up words even though they did not really mean anything sort
of to describe some unspecifiable thing 
now he is writing them out 
nam says that she used to do that when she was a kid 
now i certainly never remember doing any thing like that 
she also remembers uh taking pictures to people and asking them
what what they were 
again i would never do anything quite like that i mean any where near
like that 
i can never did anything in fact that i can remember that was very
fantasy oriented at all 
well let us see we were um www 
www 
nam is having some uh orange+juice and uh i take took a little sip
from glass before uh 
i gave it to him and nam complains said daddy took some of mine
or something like that he said 
and i said i am just testing 
and he said you are not testing 
i already what would you say 
i already had a glass 
and which means that 
d
you knew it was ok because  
i already had some and i liked it 
i already had some and i liked it yeah 
you you would already poured me a glass and you knew it was ok at that
point 
and i knew it was ok 
so why are you checking for the consistency at a later point 
it could not have changed by now 
i asked nam  could you be a little nicer and he said i hate
being nice > 
yeah you are being nice 
and then he said i when were you so nice 
and he said i had to be that way all the way home yesterday 
had to be that way all the way home yesterday 
in the car coming home from Washington D_C 
mhm 
that is true 
you were good yesterday 
mhm 
then why ca not i be bad today

of drinking my coffee

maybe he is come and do something nice 
zzz 
zzz 
nam use your spoon when you dip into that 
he came around the table to get some nam for his tea instead of
asking someone for it 
because he knew that if he he would be told that e  he was asking
and demanding for too too many things right 
nam use your spoon when you do that ok 
i was 
mhm 
and i am going to 
how come you did not let him pour it

precisely could just be a little bit off 
it means you tried very hard but you might have missed it just a
little 
of what

you bet your boody it is hot 
ow 
that is ause they boil these things before they put them out 
you bet your boodies 
this is not hot 
no the glass gets hotter than the plastic nam 
why 
because glass conducts heat 
oh 
and plastic is an insulator 
then why is this not so hot 
because it is not made of glass it is porcelain 
it is too made of glass 
no way 
uhhuh 
it is made of china

that is made of metal 
that is not mud 
well this 
that is metal too 
do you know how they make metal 
that is the way they looked 
ey took they turned out to 
know you mean a 
look like that color 
i know what you mean 
i know eactly what you mean 
you are talking about pottery 
yeah 
pottery is different than pottery is not the same thing as glass 
you know how they make glass 
they blow it with their with their lungs like a big balloon

instead of wheels 
do you know who this man was 
why does it thaw 
yeah 
nam 
no 
yeahhuh 
uhuh 
who 
nam 
i thought nam 
do you know why 
because he was the man who  who thought about gravity gravity 
he is the man who discovered that things fall 
why do you think why does it fall 
what is this man name nam 
because nothing is falling falling onto it 
nam nam 
sir nam 
is was a great discoverer of all the things that fall 
i am not talking about him 
the reason why they fall is because um nothing holding them up so
the center of gravity is pulling them down 
and the center of gravity where is the center of gravity in our
world 
right 
like right in the center of the earth 
very good nam 
where would you learn that 
mr wizard world 
wonderful 
ok now why do they come down 
oh sorry nam read that 
um why do they come down 
ok 
because um this one it holds this piece there so the air catches it
up and y he only sometimes he loses air on up on top 
right 
so he catches more and floats down 
and because of the center of gravity it pulls her down 
and him with that too 
ok now nam 
wait let nam do this one 
this is a tough one 
ssh 
what happened here nam 
can you tell me the whole story about what happened here 
a kid was playing

see that and it pulled out of the wall 
see those little nails 
it pulled out of the wall see that 
yeah 
you think his father going to be mad 
uhhuh 
when he lands 
mhm ok 
now this is Ross turn to read 
ok 
how does it fall 
how does it get up 
the way it falls is because 
no why does it fall 
why does it fall 
because the center of gravity is like 
right 
just 
pointed down right 
pointed down and 
uhhuh 
cause um oh because he is like fighting against the center of
gravity to get up 
very good uhhuh 
and what does he use to fight against the center of gravity 
his muscles and his bones 
his muscles right the muscles pull on the bones 
and the muscles and the bones and the heart are all together
fighting 
right 
with the center of gravity 
right 
and that that makes him act like a little missile that goes up 
and he jumps up top 
yeah 
how come he lands on his right feet 
because um his center of gravity like it it like it goes like like
d
when you when you land sort of like it seems to like want you to
land on your right feet 
m and cats and cats are made that way 
yeah 
cats are made so that when they are falling 
they land on their right feet 
right 
cause their little muscles pull their feet around 
and they always land on their feet

it pushes against it 
and fighting like yeah it pushes against the ground to push this
thing up 
same thing over here the air the air pushes against the other air

the ground which is very important 
tslke it is like it is not burning a hole only the it is like uh u

we took it back to the place and they were locked and closed and
gone 
right

worried we were just going to do the honest thing send our money back 
we will do that when we get to Pittsburgh 
we will send some money back to them to pay for it 
that is just to be honest

that the democrats can look at Reagan later as president and say hey
you won it is true but you did not win win that well 
there are a+lot of people out there who do not like what you are
doing and you have to tame it down 
you got to 
right 
you got to do what we tell you 
we are trying to represent the people and we are trying to tell you
what the people out there want 
now Reagan wo not listen if he wins too 
right 
well 
too easily

right 
run for it 
i would say also n nam still has a chance but it is it is a very very
slim chance

how about the old king of Hungary was he alive 
yeah 
he was 
in the in the fifties 
mhm 
and what else  what else happened in the fifties 
mhm 
mhm 
in the old days 
mhm 
really in the fifties 
and before the fifties what was what was it before the fifties 
was there anything in the whole world before the fifties 
animals and what else 
uhuh 
and when did nam come 
ok did he do it before the fifties or after the fifties 
and then what happened in the second world 
remember the bugs crawled out 
yeah 
his is the Navajo worlds 
right 
yeah but what happened in the second world 
what will there be there 
mhm 
i see 
what is the name of this program 
well the person who gave that boy a medallion was his great great
ancestor nam 
great great great great great great great great great ancestor 
nam 
right 
mhm 
but what is the name of the program 
beats me 
at nam says 
beats me beats me 
beats me 
want me to spank you to 
oh that is very pretty 
yes but it is harder being a second one 
yeah

that is not the way it should be in this family 
what are you saying 
www 
it is a wet wet day 
it is not possible 
yes it is too possible 
it is not possible 
it is as not possible as a cat can be a friend with a mouse 
well maybe they have not been paying attention to what he did 
right 
yeah 
that is what  
like for eample what nam 
um ca not really say 
like um Reagan   says that the starving people in nam and
things have to have to work 
is not have have to 
mhm 
for money and nam says why not just give the food to them 
right 
and what about war 
yeah 
which one wants war 
mmm nam 
ronny nam wants he says 
we will stand up to the Russians we will bomb them good 
you know one time he said that he  that he would he made a joke
and he said 
i am sending the missles now 
not funny 
not a very funny joke was it 
a+lot of people freaked out  nam 
a+lot of rather important people 
like who 
the Russians were not very happy 
the Russians were not real pleased 
how would you like it if somebody destroyed your whole country 
oh 
how would you like it if somebody made fun of something that
important 
whoa 
remember what the emperor did to Alderon 
uhuh 
do you think we should do that 
that is how it uh goes 
mhm 
like that 
mhm 
but there is an important problem 
what 
how to link them together 
let us try 
you stick them together like that 
but that wo not work because then they wo not 
oh 
well who knows the differences between Reagan and nam 
we do 
ok what are the differences 
nam says it is free lunch time and Reagan says you have to pay 
0 
nam says you can have a free lunch 
yeah

0 
yeah 
mhm 
you think there is any free lunch 
d
well with nam 
well nam there are lunches at your school are not there 
yeah but they are never free 
nam  because all most of the people in the school voted for
nam 
in our class 
uhuh 
did they 
that is why there were not any free lunches 
yeah well it serves them right right 
yes 
poor little what about the poor kids 
same thing 
no free lunches have to 
did they vote for nam the poor kids 
no way they  do not have enough money to have a car and vote 
mhm 
that is true 
but what about the teachers did the teachers vote for nam Reagan
d
mmm uh our teacher voted for nam 
oh did she 
yeah 
you know why 
because Reagan does not want to pay the teachers any money 
does not she 
does not he 
no he does not want to 
he 
i talked to a teacher and she said that uh 
teachers 
teachers were very she felt that the teachers were firmly behind
nam 
strongly nam 
yeah i know there is not much doubt about that 
but it does not seem to transcend to the 
it is funny 
the rest of the community 
and that is why i think this 
and he kept this stuff up about dying and nam was 
that is enough nam

maybe they made a mistake when they made the picture 
when they put it in the bo 
i see 
so maybe when they packaged it up for the store they put the wrong
one in there 
do you think so 
or do you think they made a mistake when they took the picture over
here 
when they made the gun and they put it into the bo 
and they gave it to you 
do you think that maybe you made a mistake 
well who made a mistake 
not the person that chose the wrong gun 
maybe the guy who made it made it right but somebody chose the
wrong one 
you do not think so 
what if you go to the store and you are supposed to buy Cherioos and
and instead you buy nam Bran 
do you say that the guy who made the nam Bran made a mistake

you say that the person who bought the nam Bran made a mistake 
he should have bought Cherioos 
who made the mistake then 
he made a mistake who made Cherioos

he did not make a mistake with Cherioos he made a mistake in that he
bought the wrong thing

somebody in Star Wars 
somebody in Star Wars 
who is it 
he does not mess up words 
he just does that funny talk 
who else messes up words 
no nam does not mess up words 
nam talks right 
nam does not even talk so that is not the answer 
who messes up words 
who messes up words like a baby 
who turns words around

do you think you could really get into Star Wars 
would not that be fun if you could really get in there and really be
part of it

some harder games 
do you think that these kids are too old for you 
maybe these kids that you are in with are pretty big kids are not
they 
have you ever played with really big kids like this before

what do you mean they beat your words 
the big five year olds do that right 
you know what you can do 
well that is one thing you can do 
you know else you can do 
you can get the four year olds all organized ok 
get them into a a little group 
get all the four year olds so they can figure out how to get those
five year olds to stop it 
what you need+to do is get a bunch of friends and then if those
five year olds come by and bother you you guys can work together and
stop them 
hide or play tricks on them 
play tricks on the five year olds 
you can stay away but i think the best idea is to play tricks on
them 
say 
you five year olds are going to be the losers 
i have a better idea 
we are going to play trick on you 
i have a better idea 
petition 
the four year olds can petition to have the five year olds removed

that would scare them away

get all of your bunch to figure out a plan

well maybe we could just go and take a look 
once we get there then we can figure out how to get them to really
buy it right 
is that the idea nam 
how are you going to get R_two_D_two 
he is being very noncommittal 
how are you going to get your parents to get you R_two_D_two 
say nothing and hope 
and what else do you do 
what 
work hard with your other new toys 
show that you are a good boy 
nam 
poor nam 
and maybe you will get something nice 
oh i know another way you can get your R_two_D_two 
take your money out of your pig bank 
would you like to do that 
maybe it is time to take your money out of your pig bank 
and then you do not have to be nice 
you can take your own little money 
you do not have to be nice 
is not that great 
do you like it better when you are not nice or when you are nice 
when he does not have to be nice 
it is better when he does not have to be nice 
you put that in his mouth 
he is nice so he does not have to be nice 
ok nam would you like to eat some breakfast 
no we ca not 
how are we going to buy it 
oh wait 
now wait a second 
if it does not cost a+lot of money there will be no problem in buying
it 
what do you mean even if it does not cost a+lot of money we can
still buy it 
you mean that if it does cost a+lot of money then we ca not buy it 
if it costs a+lot of money then we ca not buy it 
what did you mean 
tell me the whole idea again 
that is what he meant if it is not too much money then we can buy it
d
but he said even if it does not 
so he is got even if wrong 
he means if it does not cost a+lot of money then we can buy it 
what about even if it does cost a+lot of money 
then will we buy it 
not if it costs too much money no 
and even if he does not finish his breakfast 
in other words we still have a+lot of action+figures to buy

well maybe they are for grandfather and grandmother 
i am not sure

much

oh you get to do some 
ahhah 
i am falling

what was it 
and you hit nam and so what is the problem 
and what other problem was there

and you still have not apologized to your Grandfather 
so there are three bad things 
first that you hit nam 
ok four count them 
to nam you did not apologize to nam 
ok and then third 
yeah 
and four 
no that was not that is not something wrong 
going to your room is a punishment it is not something you did wrong
d
ok you want me to tell you what the fourth is 
you did not apologize to grandfather for not talking to him 
you still have not done that you could do that still 
no he did not do that 
and there is one more of the thing that you did that was wrong 
is that you made it so your father could not talk to grandfather 
five things

of those five there is one that we can still fi 
daddy 
ok 
two of them you fi one of them right now

bed when he was all wet 
why what do you mean even when they are dry 
oh that is true

d
right 
that is how he put it 
uhuh 
it was a huge balloon uh

oh that is great nam that is great 
nam did you see that 
at 
they did 
at Children Palace uh 
when did you guys go to Children Palace 
oh you went you saw them on tv

how come you learned learned it from him 
he does 
do you ever play with him at all 
who do you play with now 
yeah who do you play with now 
and 
and 
nam and nam no 
and who else 
nam 
nam 
ok 
that means you did not go outside 
it means do not go 
we cuffed outside so we not outside right 
we no 
we did not go outside so cuffed means did not go 
how about we cuffed go outside 
what do you say 
uncuffed go

uncuffed good very good 
tell the whole story now 
uhhum 
uhhum 
well where where are the meat 
where is the meat 
in his tummy 
yeah but in meat eaters where is the meat 
so on the meat eaters the meat is all over and on the planter
eaters do not have any meat 
nam that ca not be right 
that does not make sense 
all animals have me are full with meat 
meat eater means they eat meat 
dad 
yes nam just a minute 
what is that 
bologna and um mayonnaise mayonnaise not butter it is not nam 
oh 
it is not butter 
is that butter 
no 
they are recording 
that is ok 
um nam it does not make any sense 
to say that that the plant eaters do not have any meat 
is this butter 
because their bodies are made of meat 
your body is made of meat 
only if you eat meat 
you have meat in it 
yeah you have meat in your body 
yeah but there is no meat in your tummy unless you eat meat 
you see you got to understand something ok 
your tummy if you eat plants your tummy takes the plants and puts
them into the tummy and makes them into meat and puts the meat all
over your body 
muscles 
muscles muscles are meat 
you take plants ok you you see that apple sauce 
that is not meat is it 
now if you eat that apple sauce what is going to happen 
no it will go no your going to make apple sauce arms 
no 
which is right unless you want seconds or thirds or in case you
want seconds or thirds 
which one did you say 
what is the difference 
hum 
it make more sense 
good nam 
do you want some milk 
oh i am sorry nam nam spilt some water 
what happened nam 
tell the whole story 
well what is you say 
yeah go ahead it is ok 
tell the whole story 
and it feels like i was shocked 
shocked 
i feel something in my neck and it feels like i was shocked 
it felt like i was shocked 
uhuh 
what 
sure they can 
but how do you get a headache that shocks 
you must be sick 
how about mom

why did the bear cross the street nam 
right

mom makes good toast 
why nam 
right a pony has four legs 
very good 
i want to interject that um this i believe that this comes from
you telling him that you did not even want to hear him asking 
not tonight but other times 
there has been quite a deal made over asking 
sometime i do i do not even want to hear you ask for it 
yeah and 
and so he asked could i ask 
yeah and it sounds like a politeness form but it actually has a
very obvious function may i ask can i get away with it 
well he may have i doubt i doubt that eplanation 
i ca not imagine but he you know 
certainly certainly it could be supported it could be supported

ah  
i do not oh i do so like hmm 
how did he get them to eat them 
i should have had some dessert to keep him at the table longer 
um 
nam 
i am trying to think of what i have here 
how about a little cocoa milk 
would you like some cocoa nam 
with some 
uh with some whipped cream in it 
cocoa milk 
no cold cocoa 
yes or no 
ok 
that 
no whip creme on the table and you can do it yourself 
you can 
sit down on your chair and nam you can do it 
let dad show you how to do it eactly the right way 
no no no 
first you first you know what we do 
push it 
ok 
first we shake it up 
no 
first shake it up real hard 
ok 
no 
let us wait until you get the whipped creme i mean until you get
until you get something to put it on 
this would be better hot 
you can squirt it yourself 
ok now turn it upside+down 
and then then you just give it a little squirt 
you hold it with one hand and squirt it with the other 
yeah 
got the idea 
now with your finger on the side you just press it from from this
side press it 
i do not know if there is going to be enough in there 
well ok that is all 
that is all 
i feel like having something with this on top 
well there is not hardly anything 
d
i will have some 
you have ginger+ale and whipped cream 
oo barfie 
oh 
well after seeing that house that nam last week i just never
want to be in a house like that 
why 
oh it is it is just too much work 
too much just to think about even if she does not do any work on it
d
what is she doing 
pretty messy 
i guess she had about two thousand 
you have one already do not you 
i will take this 
here 
wipe it off on this 
here 
no give him that one 
you got to wipe it off 
ok 
wipe it off 
that is right 
um this 
she she put about three thousand dollars into this um quilting
business and she has not made any money on it 
and she uses the basement for 
the whole house is like full of little projects that she is started
d
little rugs and things; weaving 
nice rugs 
yeah really 
not not really that great 
i would say just mediocre 
when she is losing money does she realize it 
well she would like to regard as  
does she realize 
why did they bring water outside 
the teachers have water to drink 
do you drink it too 
where do you have your snack 
inside or outside 
oh 
i see 
do they bring tables outside 
or do you sit around on the steps and have your snack 
oh no 
i would better get a 
that is a little baby bug 
just a little baby baby bug 
do you really think  was serious about  
cocoa 
if you want to drink it 
i do not even really want you to 
no you do not mi the two 
you are not you are not going to need eat anything 
find out 
that is just chocolate soda 
eh 
i do not think it is going to be too bad 
chocolate ginger+ale soda 
the thing is if they are serious about leaving then they won not put
a real fight to get that rent increase stopped 
i think they i think they prefer not to 
it is the matter of of the amount i think 
yeah 
yeah they   what would they charge for rent in nineteen seventy
five was the first release that they had in a long time 
i just do not know 
no the inference from the letter 
yeah 
that 
they had a ten dollar raise 
when they came they were pay they were paying hundred and twenty
dollars 
hhmm this apartment was hundred and twenty dollars 
no whatever apartment they was in 
oh 
and they had a ten dollar raise the first the first year 
ey had a studio a studio 
yeah they had a ten dollar raise the first year 
in other words every year it is been ten dollars 
yeah 
i feel sorry for some of these people that that are on like two
hundred dollar fellowships or something 
how are they going to live 
especially the ones that have three kids 
yeah 
you are you are sweet 
oh 
thing is 
like everybody of+course is going to join some kind of a 
or sign something saying they do not want to pay more rent 
big deal 
d
no  
no it is a matter it is a matter it is a matter of having some uh 
legal 
legal reason 
yeah well you know it is that K nam 
i would love to show him up 
yeah 
my my feeling is it is just given him aggravation 
yeah 
d
want me to try it 
see how i like it 
worth the satisfaction giving  
oh it is pretty good 
tastes good 
i like it 
having provided that that there is some justification

putting up a fight

do you like wo books with words more 
what type do like better 
want to play with this for a little 
i can show you some things about it 
you 
do you know what these are for 
i will show you 
they are for taking the car apart 
do you want to take the car apart 
ok 
do you want to take this 
let us take the people out first 
ok 
how do you how do you think you get that off 
what is that 
yes 
me 
ok 
just like that 
now turn it 
no 
the other way 
keep on turning it 
yes 
you can probably turn it with your fingers now 
ok 
can you take out these side things 
let us take everything apart 
ok 
now 
use a screwdriver 
you can take these side things out 
let us take everything 
we can take 
all these things come off 
even the wheels 
and 
do you know what that is 
what does that look like 
that is a little jack 
so that you can hold up the car 
i think it is a jack 
so you can hold up the car like that 
when you are taking off a wheel 
it makes it easy to take a wheel off 
ok 
now the other way 
ok 
now you now you can screw it off with your fingers 
d
yeah 
ok 
you can do it with your fingers now 
no 
just as soon this becomes easy enough 
no 
the other way 
you have to turn it the other way 
ok 
well 
now you have to take off the wheels 
and 
then the wood part will come off 
no 
that is making it tighter 
you can probably use your fingers now 
no 
the other way 
the way you were  
oops 
boy 
yeah 
come+on 
just do it the way that makes it easier rather than harder 
ok 
you are really taking it apart 
are not you 
do you want to try the other side 
do you want to take the headlights off 
hmm 
you have two more wheels 
on the other side 
oh

do you want to take that one out first 
that is the last part to take out 
no 
just the just the end pieces 
the the lights or the bumpers 
if you want to 
sure 
yeah 
the these are just connected to the to the headlights 
after you take the headlights off those will come off 
i do not know 
the other way 
there you go 
where is the 
there it is 
i think you can do it with your fingers 
can you take 
yeah 
can you take that off 
for that you need the 
what do you need for that 
another tool 
you need the wrench 
that is right 
the engine 
ok 
the way it makes it easier 
i think you can do it with your fingers 
ok 
you are 
you are going to have taken it completely apart 
take these that out 
the screwdriver makes it easier

when they put cars up they only do one end of the car 
here

thank+you 
oh 
wait a minute 
i got to do a little bit more 
it is still tight 
ok 
now you could do it 
do you know how to put this car back together again when you are
finished taking it apart 
oh 
i think that would be the hardest part 
putting it back together again 
huh 
ok 
yeah 
oh 
we have got one more wheel back here before you can take the sides
out and and other screws here 
want me to do this one 
or do you want to do it 
you know what this part of the car called 
well 
it is a screw on this car 
but on real cars it is called a hubcap 
well 
it is not really a hubcap 
but it looks like the hubcap part of a real car 
yeah 
it is a plastic screw 
yeah 
that is true 
i think that goes from the front the 
that is the uh windshield i think 
do you want to finish taking that screw out so you can take the side
out 
oh 
and there is the trunk 
here finish that one so we can take the side out 
oh 
boy 
and then 
now you can take it out 
oh 
oh 
look 
it is all falling apart 
oh

how are we ever going to get this back together again 
here 
yeah 
i think you got to go the other direction 
you are making it tighter 
do you have a car like this at your school 
oh 
can you take the cap you go in apart just like this 
oh 
oh 
i see 
got to unscrew that 
oh 
it even has a motor 
wow 
and 
and uh here is a screw here nam 
and the those are the the headlights  right 
that is an awful big screwdriver 
i think the one that you have at home would work better 
mmhm 
right 
do you think it would 
is it really lost 
or is it just someplace with your toys 
you got to go the other way 
in what car 
uh 
really 
oh 
i think this is a really nice toy 
yes 
i do 
i do not know 
let me see 
that is unusual 
i do not know what that is 
oh 
i see 
it slides out 
you know what that was i think 
i am not sure 
but i think that was just a spare 
i do not know why that was there 
that is funny 
here it is 
oh 
boy 
yeah 
uh 
you are almost done really 
you know what i would like to do 
i would like to put it back together 
cause that would be a real challenge 
i could help you 
would you help me a little bit 
all+right 
why do not you finish that 
it is not finished 
and then we will start putting it together 
your nam used to take things apart all the time when he was
a little boy too 
he one time he took apart a whole radio 
and he did not know how to put it back together again 
well 
he just got a screwdriver and started taking it apart 
and nam got very angry cause it was a good radio 
oh 
i do not think anything very serious 
but now he knows how to put things back together again 
ok 
looks like that is about it 
is not it 
are there any other other screws on there that you could take out 
0 
i asked you a question 
are there any other screws that you could take out there 
yes or no 
right 
you are right 
there are not 
hmm 
that is a wrench 
that 
you could have used that for some of them but uh 
some of the screws did 
but instead you used the screwdriver 
ok 
let us figure out 
es this look like a car 
it does not even look like a car anymore 
oh 
boy 
um 
no 
that does not come out though 
ok 
i think this is the top of the car because this is where the people
sit 
i think 
ok 
now 
that means we have to put the headlights in front 
right 
or in back too 
that is true 
this is the trunk 
over here 
i think 
it is not 
all+right 
le let us see here 
d
oh 
boy

let me try 
ok 
oh 
no 
they need+to be the blue ones 
the blue ones are the thin ones 
yeah 
all+right 
would you rather look at the book for a few minutes 
and then we will do this later 
cause they want us to read a story from that book 
do you want to do that

and then 
ok 
let us get on this 
we have to be on the mat 
come on the mat 
sure

oh

what kind of a name is that 
what is that 
yeah 
ok 
this little girl is is rolling her kitty in a baby carriage 
do you trunk that kitty a baby or just a pretend baby 
yeah 
is that little girl wearing real little girl clothes 
they look kind of funny to me 
it looks like they are her mommy old clothes 
do little girls usually have purses like that and big hats 
no 
that is pretty silly 
she is playing dress up 
just like you do sometimes 
uh+oh 
what is happening here 
what happened 
what is that kitty doing there 
hmm 
hiding 
that is right 
the kitty ran away while the little girl was picking a flower 
and she goes 
oh my goodness 
see 
she is all suprised 
and the kitty ran behind the tree 
and he is hiding 
and he is even smiling 
is not he 
pretty funny ok 
and the little girl all upset 
is not she 
and what is she doing 
who is she going to go talk to here 
is that a real police+officer 
that looks like a little boy dressed up as a police+officer 
and he he is blowing his whistle 
and she says 
oh no 
oh no 
my kitty gone 
and the police+officer what points to the 
yeah 
and says 
there is your kitty lady 
the kitty was found 
and the police+officer walking over here to start to get the kitty 
but does that kitty look happy or sad now 
mad 
right 
and what happened to that police+officer when he tried to catch the
kitty 
i know 
cause he tripped and fell on his shirt 
it was too big for him 
what kind of shirt is that guy using wearing 
nam shirt 
just like the one you are going to get 
yeah 
ok 
so 
now they are going to try to catch the kitty some more 
and they are walking up very quietly saying 
here kitty kitty kitty 
is that how people call kittys 
they hit them 
is that very nice 
to hit kittys 
i sure would not like that 
no 
it is not really nice to hit animals 
people do not do that 
only mean people who do that 
so 
here is the kitty 
and he is walking to a into a great big what 
right 
so 
they all go through the pipe 
and here is the kitty watching them from the other end 
and they are all going to go through the pipe to try and get that
kitty 
and as soon as they get out what happens 
he fell into the little water 
see 
any the kitty just ran up the hill 
cause kittys are better climbers than people 
are not they 
would you like to fall in water like that right on your nose 
hmm 
i would not like that 
yeah 
but they do not have their clothes off 
do they 
no 
oh 
is not that a nice police+officer 
he is helping the girl out of the of the pipe 
see 
he is very gallant 
but uh+oh 
they fall again 
right in the water 
all their clothes are going to get muddy 
huh 
have you ever gone in the water with all your clothes on like that
d
that would be funny 
yeah 
that is true 
that kitty thinks it is awfully funny that they are falling in the
water 
huh 
ok 
why do you think that kitty has whiskers coming out of his top of
his head 
well 
it looks kind of strange 
uh+oh 
they all splash in the water 
and there the kitty goes running through the pipe again 
and they are so angry this little boy and girl who are dress up
like a lady and a police+officer 
i think they are really determined to get the cat now 
but who get him 
who got the cat 
the little boy 
right 
the one that was wearing the nam shirt 
he caught the cat 
oh 
and look the cat is is on+top+of that little boy head 
es he look very happy 
oh 
i think he is scratching him 
he must hurt him 
huh 
have you ever been scratched by a cat 
did nam cat ever scratch you 
oh 
that hurts 
does not it 
when they go can you show me how it feels 
oh 
yeah 
that is how it feels 
so 
this little girl is very angry at the little toy for letting the
cat go on+top+of the police+officer boy head 
and she is bawling him out 
you know how you can tell she is bawling him out 
she is holding onto his ear and going can you do that with your hand
d
go 
you do not know how 
hmm 
ok 
they the cat starts running up the tree 
do you think the cat going to escape 
think so 
look 
i can even see the scratch marks on the little police+officer 
oh no 
they all 
he climbed up the tree to try to get the cat 
the cat hanging on that little limb 
you think the limb going to break 
hmm 
you tell me 
what happened 
he got the kitty 
that is right 
and what is this boy doing here 
something not very nice 
he is sticking his tongue out 
no 
that is just a little boy 
that is not really a police+officer nam 
it is just a little boy dressed up as a police+officer 
she the great big funny shoes and the big blue shirt 
that is not really a police+officer 
he just has a police outfit on 
ok 
anyway 
the police boy got the cat 
and the lady the little girl that is dressed like a lady is so happy
d
and the little boy that is got the nam shirt on is very angry 
and so he stuck his tongue out 
and then what happened 
the cat fell 
and the little boy fell 
see how the branch broke 
that is what could happen when you go climbing on trees and  do not
go on strong l limbs the branch breaks and goes 
crash 
and the cat fell 
and the little girl caught him and the police+officer fell and landed
right on the little boy with the nam shirt 
and they are all just so battered and tired and dirty 
and here they go walking home 
ecept this time the kitty is following 
behind and the little boy with the nam shirt is riding in the
carriage 
they are so tired and so scratched up 
and the little girl is going into her house 
and what is she bringing them

look in the front and see what is there 
look at that 
what do you think you would like to do with it 
all+right we will do it 
how do you take it off 
no you have to to repair 
you have to take something off 
see you have to take these off 
do you have a screwdriver 
get a screwdriver 
yeah that is a screwdriver 
ok now take remove that ok 
that is it 
turn it the other way 
no 
all+right what would you like to do with it 
hmm 
want to put it back inside 
ok turn it 
are not you going to turn it 
that is it 
screw it together 
ok turn 
good 
oh very good 
all+right now  put that one all back 
do not want to repair this 
want to drive it 
all+right where does that piece go 
i do not know 
why do not you open the front and see if it belongs in the front 
i guess not 
look in the back 
check the back maybe it is something that goes in the back 
no 
i think it is an etra then 
why do not you slip it somewhere 
why do not you put it in somewhere 
there ok 
that is a pretty nice car huh 
what 
oh that has a book in it for a story 
would you like to hear a story 
would you like to play store 
huh

for school 
would you like to play store 
what would you like to do 
would you like me to read you a story 
would you like to find out what the story book all about 
yeah then play with it 
go ahead 
is not it a nice little cash register 
what 
i would be glad to 
but we have to get a screwdriver 
and we have to take off the tire 
ok 
like that 
yeah you just keep turning that then that will come off 
keep turning keep turning keep turning just move your wrist as
you turn 
can you move your wrist 
like this all+right

good you can use a screwdriver or you know you can even use your
wrist you can even do it like this for a while until you can turn
it like that 
that is it 
good 
and then you tighten it with the screwdriver i think that is a
better idea

got these little shields and so that helps make them to be able to
go faster

little air resistance so it can go real fast 
it can go faster than most bicycle can go

that makes it easier to go a+lot faster

what is the matter with it 
oh 
ok why do not 
here 
that is right 
ok i think if you use both hands it will be easier use one hand
to hold 
ok that is right 
go ahead 
oh you know you may have to use one hand to hold the wheel and one
hand to work the screwdriver ok 
nam 
do you think you would like me to read the story to you

ok do you want to do you want to put the car back together and play
store

ok put it put it in here 
wait a minute 
there 
ok now i think you can screw that back in 
turn it the other way 
turn it 
that is right 
yeah 
you turn it in one direction when you want to take the screw out 
and you turn it in the other direction when you want to put it in 
that would take it out nam 
turn it the other way to put it in 
ok that is good 
that is very good 
you are doing a good job 
well you have to learn how to turn it between your fingers 
that is good 
that is very good 
that is very good 
i know 
just rela 
see 
see and in fact if you use two hands it might be a little bit
easier for you 
should 
let us try to put another wheel in 
ok 
all+right 
ok all+right 
i will hold the car for you and you get a screw that is right 
put it in and in fact you know what might be a little bit easier
to begin with 
turn it with your hand first 
that is right 
and then when you have to tighten it you can use a screwdriver 
all+right 
you can 
now put the screwdriver in 
ok that is right 
and tighten it 
tighten it

oops 
big foot big foot in the way 
look the people are building the zoos here and to transport all
the animals from one zoo to another 
that is might be one reason why why they need+to be moved it is
because they need more zoo keepers in the other one 
why else do you think they might be moving them 
yeah 
right that is possible 
what about where they live 
what about where they like their homes

now wait a minute you got to stop and look at all of these first 
stop and look closely at all these files 
mmhm 
you think that one 
that is a pretty good choice because this is a needs a small file
and needs a file that is very fine

one even 
let us look in my uh other tools kit here 
where is it

it is get a nice handle on it 
all+right come up here 
now i want you to take that file and i am going to show you first 
and you take this 
you see how i got this at an angle like this 
wait a minute 
back up a little bit and just file like this 
until you and then you occasionally run run your finger across
it like this to see that you are getting it nice and smooth

try not to get the point there try not to get the paint off 
go slowly that is it 
that is pretty good already 
now get the top part of this off there 
gee i think you did a pretty good job 
all+right now let us do the other 
let me just finish up on this 
let us see gee that is not 
the only think you did about as well as anybody 
all+right wait a minute 
well you are you are doing it you do not have to

it at home

going in 
what did you say nam he wakes up in the sities 
mamma 
yeah 
am i going net door to nancy today 
not to day 
know whats happening today 
what 
everybody leaving school early 
one oclock 
mmhm 
but i want to go on the roof 
and i have to teach nam 
no no thursday i normally supposed to have meetings but i
cancelled them now 
how do you feel nam 
huh 
um the state of shock is now a state of semi shock 
it is not shock shock is really inaccurate but i you know i feel
upset 
i am a friend called ah really i would hardly call him a friend but
one of the full time you know what had happened 
i would been observed in the fall 
um hmm 
by nam nam is the literary editor of the nation and
a famous man now let us just say ah his grey beard is known all
over the world 
anyway he observed one of my american novel classes and and even
though he said to to me after the class what a 
beautiful class he never wrote it up 
you elephant 
um hmm 
so then now yesterday when i got the initial note about the
possibility sad news just forthcoming 
from my friend who did not just want to drop the bomb to me on the
phone 
i interpreted i thought gee maybe the fact that Copoya
recommendation was not in was a factor 
after all it was a logical thought so i went and bothered one of
his secretaries who i had asked about it oh two weeks ago which i
do not think it was hardly early considering he observed me last
October would you 
hunm 
and it is technically supposed to be in the term you are observed 
mmhm 
so anyway as secretaries are wo not to do she must have made a
bothering call to him again 
um mm 
he is just late that is all and lazy 
um hmm 
i am mean he is just involved in other all+right more important but
you know mine equally important to me 
so anyway he called me last night 
um hmm 
because he is also he serves on the P_and_B promotion and budget
committee of the english department and he already had known about
this cut 
uh huh 
and ah i ca not understand his use of this word talking about
study of language he said ah 
i was appalled to hear appalled list to this word nam said
what utter arrogance utter 
i was appalled to hear from the english secretary that 
you had asked her several times for your observation 
you would think he might use something like embarrassed you know or
you know 
fire 
it heals it healed 
it  could was just thrown so that perhaps he did not really mean
it 
it was just thrown on the other hand 
he is a man 
could not think of anything else 
who should not do that  ah ha 
if you did this if if you did this you would make spiderman 
to something into different things 
enormous intellect and his language is his is his weapon so one

drove up and his nose bleed  an and  
yeah actually nam nam discovered it 
right 
we came in yesterday and we came in the door and we i think we
still even had our did we have our coat on 
we had just walked in 
for all we know what really might have happened was that when
gerbil heard us turn the key gerbil has good hearing and he might
have jumped 
i  
and sometimes he gets his little no we had his little nose
underneath in a hidden place because he loves to burrow in there 
and he got his nose caught 
hmm 
hmm hmm 
oh 
that must have hurt 
and when nam went to look 
yes it must have recently happened 
hmm hmm 
and he was trying to do you remember what he was trying to do 
yeah

ok nam 
ok 
what did you discover

mmhm 
ok 
why does he have to put what on 
ok 
why do not you go tell him that he 
can stay as company ok 
he has to put it on so he can he gets all of your words 
he wants to hear everything that you have to say 
would you like coffee nam 
ah if you have some made yeah or some 
i will make some

mommy 
it does not happen occasionally it happens regularly 
d
uh ha ha 
ok 
come on 
nam waiting 
can i tell you something 
that did you finish the dragon in school

how did you finish it 
yeah 
painting the legs 
what color 
oh did you do any painting

what colors did you use 
that is right 
blue yeah 
you need soap 
here 
blue and red do make purple you are right 
blue and red make a good purple nam 
yes i was just looking them at them they look very healthy 
well 
no actually it is untrue 
i cannot tell a lie 
someone gave me a gardenia over there and i have it about three
days and it is dying 
so it must be 
oh it 
very sensitive to heat and i know 
the lemon seed never germinated 
it never came up 
but we we could show nam this is ah from Vietnam 
what is the name of it again 
i forgot 
aluminum 
it is an aluminum plant 
that is a fern 
this is a sweet potato plant 
nam can tell i bet 
mmhm 
he sees the potato 
but my gardenia is very unhappy 
it is all yellow and very sad 
bungle 
i keep moving it to find a happy home for it but it does not like
it here 
so 
well sometimes they go into shock when you move them 
and ah 
yes 
some something is very that gardenia is not adjusted 
it is not adjusted to anything 
i have a feeling what happened is it is in a very small pot Julia
and there are roots eposed some of the roots eposed and i am
afraid to put it into additional shock by changing the pot you know
d
it is used to it is pot just the way a baby used is used to a certain
crib or a place to sleep 
so i am afraid to shock it even more but i think it needs it huh
ha 
ok 
hey hey hey 
you know what 
that is a friendly cactus but i think it likes to be left alone 
just talk to it a little 
there was a woman on television nam 
she said that plant this is her theory 
she has a theory that plants have feelings 
and that if you come over to your plants 
listen 
just come over to them right 
like right here 
look 
and watch if i do this 
i do not even say anything 
i just look at them 
and i go like this i go 
and just smiling at a plant makes that plant happy 
just like smiling at a person 
watch the lamp behind you look 
yeah i know it is come down a couple of times 
ok 
so maybe if you give my plants a big smile it will work 
it is shaking 
well just be aware of it 
watch out 
put it  
mmhm 
i 
is is this a wind up one 
ah yeah this is a wind up watch nam

let us open some windows 
aingt it warm in here for you 
and it is all wound up now 
it is going up 
mmhm

do you want to see something interesting 
yeah 
this is taken in a factory 
what kind of factory do you think it is 
yeah and you know what it says here 
it says that these men are smiling 
see them smiling 
because the factory is making more airairplanes 
and if the factory makes more airairplanes they work more 
it helps them have more 
no 
more to do and more money and better jobs 
and let us see what else 
let us see oh

ah yeah if if possible 
mmhm 
ah um i could meet you downstairs you know whatever 
whatever is 
all+right let us see 
why do not you set it up nam because you go in the morning 
yeah um ok well we we usually ride in with ah art our
neighbor downstairs whose ah son 
he came home with nam thing 
oh so 
yeah so i know 
yeah you know so ah i mean i i think 
i know if there is room 
hello 
otherwise we will go in on the bus 
uhhuh 
oh just a moment 
nam 
yeah 
one moment  
this is the time of the cave man 
do you remember when we saw in the museum of the cave drawings the
cave paintings nam 
at the museum of modern art 
they have that little cave 
it is the same thing 
only this is a cartoon 
what is he using the fires look at the painting on the wall 
what do you see nam 
mmm 
what are they talking about nam 
ha ha ha what happened 
what happened 
be quiet 
yes fire could be good 
how could fire be good 
nam 
hmm 
how did they start the fire 
do you remember how they used to start it when they did not have
matches 
rub sticks 
rub sticks very hard 
the friction will do it 
there they go 
look watch 
watch 
watch it 
oh 
see that 
a spark 
oh he is made a discovery 
would you like to have lived then nam 
in a cave 
no 
why not 
there were wild animals but it was nice and snug and cozy in a
cave 
do not you think so 
and you could draw on your own walls 
i do not let you draw on the walls 
you could draw on the walls in a cave 
how about that 
you could decorate your whole room 
ha ha ha 
right 
yeah it is a good reason 
what is a bad reason 
what is a reason against it 
mmm 
what 
yes 
what 
what fur 
a person does not have fur 
oh for you mean the fur clothing 
oh 
so in other words you mean you could not control a fire 
they may get too large and get burned 
that is true they had to be careful 
well that is what they were saying in this little story 
they were saying they learned how to put fires out 
how do you put it out 
do you remember 
did you notice 
how did the man put the fire out 
blowing 
no blowing did not put it out 
blowing made it bigger 
how did he put it out 
how did he make it smaller 
with what 
something cold and wet 
what 
right 
water 
water 
see when you blow on it your mouth the air that comes out of your
mouth 
right 
yeah 
that makes the fire get 
you know how 
you use a damper 
nam that damper we saw over the fireplace 
and you squeeze the thing together right 
makes air the same effect if you go 
same thing 
so you know one thing if you ever are near a fire and it is
dangerous right 
and if you want to put it out you do not do what 
you do not blow on it do you 
that will make it 
bigger 
so what do you do 
you go get some 
water 
cold water 
hmm hmm 
good idea 
or else the first thing you do is you call your mommy if you see a
fire 
give a little to nam 
can i feed you a little bit 
no 
do not 
it might fall off the     avoid it 
it might fall off 
well come here come close 
i will give you a hand 
come close 
here is dinner 
ready set catch 
wait a minute 
please 
ok 
wait 
i am tired  
ready 
come closer 
oh catch it all 
very good 
nam what about you 
what 
what did he do 
how did he put that fire out just now 
in a most interesting way 
what do you think happened when he turned the glass when he
inverted it 
he turned it upside+down and put it over the flame 
what do you think happened to it 
why do you think the fire went out 
if you take this and you cover something with it what do you keep
out 
what are you keeping out 
you are keeping out air 
and fires need air oygen 
mmhm 
so you could put a fire out by covering it 
sometimes they tell you you can put a fire out by using a heavy
blanket and smothering it 
but it is got to be a heavy blanket because if it was just a little
thin piece of material it would catch fire see they are showing you
all kinds of fires 
that is an electrical fire

if a bunny would come along 
and see peas in a garden 
do you think bunnies like peas 
yeah

do that 
they would probably say 
look at this nice girl who will feeds us

ok 
 they could probably become the friendliest bunnies in
town and if you 
you could train bunnies you know what would happen 
here will you wipe your tongue off please 
well well wait a minute now 
i do not know if they would  
how would you do it 
that is that is right you could do

d
he does not have any wings 
   
no gerbils do not have wings 
well i do not know if where gerbils go when they die to tell you

no 
they just disappear and then never where 
he 
they do not nobody sees them anymore 
is that it

yeah it is stinking  but  this is the bureaucracy 
yeah 
it sure is he he  um 
could i have some more milk 
yeah sure 
you well &hi:  i i ca not honestly say that it took it really
affected my feelings that is my attitude toward that of+course it
affects your financial situation 
mom 
but it did not affect my feelings toward the job 
you know losing it 
but uhm 
yeah right 
mmhm 
eactly 
right yeah 
mmhm 
mmhm 
well  it had not i what is so of+course frustrating is that it
does not relate to  
some more milk 
one moment i am on the phone 
it is so unrelated to merit you know 
the decisions are 
well  a+lot of decisions do not get made on that basis Helen 
huh hah hah hah sometimes but rarely 
right 
mmhm uhhuh 
ok 
well i hope so 
i am a little disillusioning 
you know 
they were getting more than a pound of flesh from me 
milk 
and in terms of work you know 
what 
well that is true 
but i mean there was a+lot of input there 
and you know in terms of 
d
not only to my students  but to various departmental services 
mmhm

tetracycline pill 
d
very lightly 
and after he does that gerbil lies down curls up and sleeps it
off 
and it takes a big drink of water 
is not that funny 
but it is well you see it is a very sweet little thing 
we are really are rooting for it 
kuhz it is rather it is rather you know how some animal animals are
so nothing 
but it is very a responsive little thing yes  and it was a pathetic
situation so we are hoping 
but it was uh rather badly injured so it 
yes so we we we would still say it is on the  
well it is stable but critical 
no no i would say it is passed that 
oh nam says he he would like to  revamp 
he is off the critical list 
it is off the critical list 
   vis Helen wants to know about visiting hours 
 oh yes 
he is ambulatory 
yeah he is ambulatory nam thinks 
huh uh 
well you got to laugh about something laugh about gerbil 
he does not he hates to wear those  
certainly do not laugh about my predicament

he wanted more food 
he had to have more for nam 
he just had to have more 
and look what he did 
he gave him the whole bo 
and now look at nam 
nam 
wait 
i want to see it 
nam i think has heard this story once too much 
there was just one thing to do 
i put nam into the flower bowl 
there nam i said this will hold you 
but no the flower bowl could not hold him 
and then he put him in a mommy big pot 
and then he put him in the biggest pot 
and then he rushed up the stairs to get him to the 
bath tub 
at last there is nam i said 
this tub holds my father 
this tub holds my mother 
so it will hold you 
but pretty soon 
nam too big for the tub 
and he crashes down to the basement 
look at this nam 
and the little boy called the 
police 
he said help help 
i fed my fish too much 
what said the police+officer 
mr carp told you not to but you did 
the police+officer sees how big the fish is and calls the fire
department 
and they put they do the most amazing thing 
they hook on to the tail and they put wheels on the the fish 
and they take him to the town 
where do they take him 
to the to the  to the beach 
no they do not  nam 
nam thinks they take the fish to the beach 
where do they take him 
to the pool 
the pool 
and there he is 
they throw him in the pool 
all the people have to come out 
and pretty soon he is too big for the pool too 
what are they going to do 
they call up mr carp and they say help 
and mr carp arrived with all his equipment 
see 
black bo 
and 
he splashes right in 
and he saves the day 
he makes the fish small 
little again 
from now on said mr carp do not feed him too much 
ow ah 
now is that is what i always do 
i feed nam so much and no more 
never more than a spot or something may happen 
and now i know what 
ok nam turn 
you hold that 
you could hold the book nam 
which one did you pick nam 
hmmm 
nam 
not not ah um 
nam pan 
ok 
or this is very long story so can i say one thing 
half of it would be all+right because it is etremely long 
ok 
nam came out of the world in the middle of a thicket 
that is in the woods nam 
oh what a beautiful look at look at the new nam 
deer 
all of the birds and animals heard nam even the owl who had
settled for a long day sleep 
did you know that owls sleep in the daytime and they are awake all
night 
that is right 
owls do the reverse of people 
and all the animals congratulated nam mother 
congratulations 
wake up wake up she said to her baby deer nam 
the little fawn lifted his head 
do you know what a fawn is 
you know how they call a baby cat a kitten 
well a baby deer is called a fawn 
the little fawn lifted his head and looked around 
he looked so frightened 
and look what he is doing 
he is walking right close to his mother 
can you see nam 
see him walking right net to his mommy 
i would do that if i was scared 
she licked him to comfort him and nudged him along 
he was learning how to walk 
and you know what 
his front legs kept going w woop wup woop wup woop wup because he
had never walked before 
finally he was able to walk 
what are you going to name him said the baby rabbit 
i will call him nam the mother answered 
like that name 
why do you like nam 
no but this is the baby rabbit 
that is the skunk 
ok that comes later 
you want to know you want me to skip that part and go where the skunk
is 
ok well let us see 
the forest was beautiful 
it was summertime 
nam liked to follow his mother 
everyone said hello 
the squirrels the chipmunks the possums everyone 
even this little rabbit became his best friend and his name was
thumper 
thumper the rabbit 
and they played together 
thumper and nam had a favorite game 
you know what their favorite game was 
do you remember 
no 
no it was summer 
how could they slide on ice 
ha hmm ha ha ha 
what do you think their favorite game was 
it is in the picture if your look really carefully 
well what is what is he doing 
what is he going over that is fallen 
mmhm 
they use to jump over logs 
they played leap log instead of leap frog 
ha ha 
there they are 
you know they jumped 
and they had a+lot of fun 
see they are friendly 
there are birds 
that is not a bird that is a butterfly 
well that picture there 
one day bea nam met the skunk 
oh 
that is a skunk 
now  the skunk happened to have a flower on his head and Bambi
thought the skunk was a 
what did he think 
a flower 
but  do you know what skunks have that is funny 
what about what is funny what is peculiar about skunks 
they smell bad 
well nam got very 
nam a young animal and just like young children sometimes you
do not sometimes you think you know something and then you find out
it is not quite the way you thought 
he is getting closer and closer and closer to the skunk and he is
trying to find out who the skunk really is and pretty soon nam had
made another friend 
they become friends 
one morning nam and his mother walked down a path a new path
with vines and bushes 
remember we went someplace where there were a+lot of vines 
where did we go 
you had a basket 
what were you picking 
berries 
remember we had to cut the vines 
a few steps more and they would be in a bright open space 
nam wanted to jump but his mother stopped him 
what is the matter mother 
it is the meadow his mother replied 
wait here until i call you 
the meadow is not always safe 
if you see me turn back run as fast as you can 
see what what could be there 
what could be there that is dangerous 
a giant deer 
maybe a wolf 
mmm 
oh you know what is there 
oh ok 
nam never took off his eyes off the mother 
a big piece of metal 
piece of metal 
yeah 
could be dangerous 
yes 
true 
yeah i got it 
and metal got sharp points 
it does 
yes 
i guess  
they they might be afraid of other animals too 
right 
because remember we 
ok i am reading 
d
nam never took his eyes off his mother as he walked with slow
cautious steps 
he saw how she listened in all directions 
then she called come 
nam pounded out 
joy seized him and he leaped into the air three four five times 
catch me his mother cried and she bounded forward 
nam started after her 
he felt as if they were flying without any effort 
as he hopped for breath a large green frog suddenly hopped out of
the clover into the pond 
nam followed it 
hello he said 
do not be afraid nam his mother said that is little nam 
his mother there they are with the other deer 
look they are playing is your aunt nam 
come and play nam nam said 
and romping 
now what 
suddenly out of the woods came the sound of hoof beats 
uh+oh what is it 
branches snapped boughs rustled and figures burnt burst out of the
woods 
they tore by like the wind made a wide circle in the grassy
meadow and vanished into the woods again where they could still be
heard galloping 
who are they 
big deer 
they are the fathers said nam 
out of the woods they came bursting breathlessly 
they looked like the mother but there was something different 
what is different nam 
let us see if we could see a difference 
how is this nam different from these 
oh the daddy deer has big antlers big jumbo horns nam 
like this can you see 
mmm 
can you see 
it is a small picture but it looks like an umbrella 
then nam saw standing on a rock a great daddy beer strong and
large 
every animal stood still quietly and rai waited 
he is very brise and very very brave and very wise 
look mother he said he stopped and looked at me 
nam was very impressed 
as years went by nam grew up 
what kinds of things did he learn 
he learned to hear things in the forest 
do you know what he could hear 
he could hear the sound of mice making a hole and he could smell
moles who dig remember the tunnel you know the moles nam that
 the  dig the tunnels underground 
yeah 
and here winter came 
and he learned all about ice the hard way did not he 
what happened 
he slipped on the ice 
and thumper thought it was a big joke 
at last the seasons changed again 
right 
winter going away 
what is coming after winter 
spring uhhuh 
and there is going to be some little tiny buds coming out on those
trees 
and things are going to start turning green 
what is what is she  what is she doing 
nam is afraid 
here let us see 
what could it be 
he smelled something 
there was a loud noise and he smelled something 
so his mother said hurry up and run 
and it you know what is was 
it was the sound of some deers and some rolling stones 
and pretty soon early one morning when nam was asleep there
nam saw the great daddy steer standing up top 
and he jumped and followed him 
and now 
look at the end of our story 
nam is no longer a little deer anymore 
nam nam developed what 
what is on nam head 
horns 
and now nam just like the daddy deer 
nam is a grownup proud daddy 
ah what happened here 
oh you know i missed that 
he met a girl deer huh 
let us see 
ecuse me 
he met a nam is his girl deer is the girl deer 
that is his girl 
ok 
ok he met a wonderful girl deer 
and a and do they get married 
is that what happened 
ha ha 
ok and they became very good friends and they decided to hang
around one another 
and he dashed they they see there there are together 
and then nam grows up 
and there is nam 
just like the original daddy deer he is prince of the forest 
he is king again 
and he is no longer afraid of anything 
because he knows all about everything 
all+right 
right

and he has this ah duel with captain hook 
pretty tricky is not it 
like  walking a tight rope huh 
aweful dangerous 
and he fights and nam is the winner and what

sure 
you want me to read with read it to you 
well this is not the most eciting book in the world to read 
this is the subway map 
ah well i always get lost in the subway 
i do not know how to read this thing 
mmhm 
well sometimes i do 
i get on the wrong train 
and i go somewhere i do not want to go 
eventually i discover i should get off 
yes and i try to find the right train 
mmhm 
hmm no 
it depends where i am going

do you want an oatmeal cookie

do i 
yes i do 
spell what 
coffee 
y e s 
you know what nam 
let us put that one away 
that phone book 
bring that over to here 
here you can look at this one 
it is just as interesting 
almost 
right 
it is got all the same things in it 
no you have to leave them there 
listen i will tell you what 
i want this one to stay 
this one and the other one stays you can do just about whatever you
want with that 
you want to write on it 
you take a magic marker and you can write on it 
because that is an old one and we are going to throw it away 
so here 
uh uh uh 
keep your hands off what you are not suppose to touch 
you could write on the outside or on the inside 
you could write your name 
a w 
you know how to make a w 
here 
that is an a 
oh i do not know 
it does not look like an a i have seen before 
yeah 
that is a that is a good wah no you have one too many strokes on
there 
yeah but the down stroke at the end does not look like a w 
oh i see 
should you what 
if it is going to make you very happy 
you did a good job then 
if you did not want anyone to recognize that no+one could 
possibly know that is a w 
you hid that very well 
do i think what

if you are a fast writer it would not take you very long at all 
you are a slow writer 
no that is scribbling 
writing fast is still writing letters 
look if you went like this

letter  first one is a big one and then the rest are little
letters

what happened what did you so with the book 
girls have vaginas 
right 
the color kittens 
by nam wise brown illustrated by nam and nam 
once there were two colored kittens with green eyes 
bush and hush 
they liked to mi and make colors 
by splashing one color into another hush 
brush 
they had buckets and buckets and buckets and buckets of colors to
splash around with 
thirty four what 
out of there colors they would make all the colors in the world 
the buckets have the colors written on them but of+course the
kittens could not read 
they had to tell by the colors 
it was very easy said 
it could be why 
red is red blue is blue said hush but they had no 
no green paint said hush and brush 
cover your mouth please 
fishing for what 
right 
that is what people usually do when they go fishing they fish for a
fish 
they catch them 
what is he doing 
ha ha ha 
oh that was not 
that was not green paint 
i do not think so 
they wanted green paint of+course because nearly every place they
wanted to go was green 
there was green water 
green as cat eyes green as grass by streams of water clear as
glass 
right 
because they had green eyes 
what the story said 
but they tried to make some green paint 
brush mied some red paint and white paint together and what did
that make 
it did not make green 
it made pink 
pink as 
pink as 
pink as a rose or a baby 
yuck 
if we are going to have you here you are going to be nice 
take him and that into the hall 
then hush mied yellow and red together and it made 
yellow and red together 
right orange as in orange tree orange as a 
orange as the setting sun sinking slowly in the sea 
the kittens were delighted but it did not make green 
then they mied red blue together and what did that make 
i did not make green 
right it made a deep dark purple 
purple as violets purple as shadows purple as plums purple as
shadows on late afternoons 
still no green 
and then  need a tissue 
what is that 
hair 
oh  wonderful kittens oh brush oh hush 
at last almost by accident the kittens poured a bucket of blue and
a bucket of yellow together and it came to pass that they made a
green as green as grass 
green as green leaves on a tree green as islands in the sea 
the little kittens were so happy with all the colors they had made
they began to paint everything around 
they painted green leaves and red berries and purple flowers and
pink cherries 
red tables and yellow chairs black trees with golden 
pears 
then the kittens got so ecited they knocked their buckets upside
down and all the colors run together 
yellow red a little blue and a little black 
and that made 
brown 
brown as a tugboat brown as old goat brown as a beaver brown 
and all that and then all that brown 
the sun went down it was evening and the sun began to disappear in
the warm dark night 
the kittens fell asleep in the warm dark night with all their
colors out of sight 
as they slept they dreamed their dream 
a wonderful dream of a red rose tree that turned all white when
you counted three 
one 
ah 
not yet no 
d
of a purple land in a pale pink sea where apples fell from a golden
tree 
and then a world of easter eggs that danced about on little short
legs 
did it say what 
no 
and they dreamed 
that a green cat danced with a little pink dog 
till they all disappeared in a soft grey fog 
and suddenly brush woke up and hush woke up 
right 
it was morning 
they crawled out of bed into a big bright world 
the sky was wild with sunshine 
the kittens were wild with purring and pouncing 
pounce pounce pounce 
they got so pouncy they knocked over the buckets and all the colors
ran out together 
there were all the colors in the world and the color kittens had
made them

what are you doing with the sponge 
i do not think you would better do that nam because you splash it over

coming to put the tile on the floor and he ca not work on a wet floor
d
do not drop it please 
oh nam whoops 
oh do not

because you are getting all that stuff into the tub 
well because that is not where it belongs 
if it is in the tub now it is going to get in your hair later on 
let me see if i can clear some of that out 
are you warm enough in there nam 
well i guess there is nothing you can do about that 
nam tell me about the summer again

oh 
mmhm 
what happened when your teachers yelled at you 
you did not pay any attention to them 
nam do not splash 
you just kept right on walking slowly up the hill 
you walked slowlyer 
it is on 
you can speak right now 
we have been speaking into it all this time 
oh no you ca not hold it nam 
not when you are in the tub 
that is dangerous 
that can nam for the same reason nam that you ca not play with
plugs 
did not you hear it before when we played it back 
ok 
well i am going to put some more hot water in the tub and we will play
it back 
and you can listen to your voice while the hot water runs into the
tub 
ok 
i have put the tape+recorder on again 
nam tell me what happened on the way home today when you were
riding in the car with nam and there was somebody on a
bicycle 
do you remember how you said that 
when you were in the car 
i think in the car she had said 
if we were we would have 
can you finish it 
we would have 
oh somebody at the door 
you talk into the tape+recorder for a minute while i get the door 
nam in the tub 
mmhm 
how did you get that scratch 
never did hurt very much did it 
you want what 
well that was all there was nam 
well i am afraid we have erased that part now 
well there is no way of getting that any more because we are tape
recording over it 
what else would you like to talk about 
do you want to tell me another story 
make up another story 
it would be nice 
tell me a story nam 
ok 
sure 
now you have to speak clearly nam 
nam remember the tape+recorder has trouble understanding so you
have to speak clearly for the tape+recorder 
no it listens 
it just listens 
sometimes it talks 
i guess when it plays back it talks does not it 
and what about nam 
oh well maybe she is with the pineapple 
where is she 
i do not see her 
and who are you pointing to 
do not pick at those nam please 
wallpaper fell off the pillow 
put meatballs on them 
and did what 
even on the toiletpaper 
nam it would be good if you came down to this side of the tub where
the microphone is 
it had a funny shaped body 
oh for a poopoo 
and it lived happily ever after 
are you ready to get you hair washed now 
we will turn this off while you get your hair washed 
what do you want to say now 
ok one more story and then you come out of the tub 
mmhm 
can i throw this out nam 
i am not understanding any of this either if you are having trouble
transcribing 
remember nam um if you want to record you have to just talk would be
better because it is awfully hard to understand 
it does not help that she is got a bit of a head cold 
nam why do not you tell us tell us what you are doing with the frog
d
why is it hopping 
where is it going 
it does not know where 
i see 
she is got the frog leg through the fish eye 
nam i would like you to say some to say a sentence 
first the way you would say it and then the way some other people
would say the same thing 
let us say how about 
it is time for a bath tonight 
you say that just the way you would say it 
ok now say it the way nam would say it 
say it the way i would say it 
how would a baby say it 
how would a boy say it 
how would a girl say it 
how would a man say it 
how would a woman say it 
ok nam in two minutes you will come out of the tub 
i guess that was the water running out of it 
if fish get out of the water 
yes 
nam time now to come out of the tub 
if you want dessert and time to play upstairs you have to come out
now 
you can just leave the water in there and it will come out 
when frogs get in the water nam they get water inside them 
we will just get you dressed 
uhhuh 
well you could pretend it is a cowboy vest 
i do not know whether it was meant to be actually a cowboy vest but
you could say it was a cowboy vest 
yeah 
well does that look better 
wow i bet it does not even hurt any more does it 
oh it looks much better 
it really does 
you are really getting well 
ok let us get your socks on 
you scratch it with your finger 
well if you scratched it that hard it would make another scratch
would not it 
then you would start all over again 
it would be hard to scratch it as hard as that metal thing would not it
d
that metal thing really scratched it hard 
yeah that must have really hurt 
no she did not mean to 
do you  this morning 
what is that nam you are doing 
hmm 
no not for now 
we are getting dressed now 
yeah well let us not use that now nam 
what 
all+right go quickly 
to open the door 
yesterday on the way home in the car she said as we went past a
bicyclist 
we might have hit him if we were still behind him 
ok what commercial was it 
oh the nam commercial 
the one about baby care 
yeah that is a nice commercial 
tells you all the nice things the nam does 
lunch made

the whole thing is a little small for you 
put the pants on 
tuck the orange shirt in nam 
yeah would you 
ok let us tuck the orange shirt in 
what 
why did he say that 
oh and he was afraid 
because he was way up in the sky 
so then what happened 
nothing 
oh 
wow 
ok 
i will get your hair brushed and then you can play in here until
we are ready to go ok 
what do you want 
yeah well we can tape 
you can taperecord nam 
but you will have to play in here where the tape+recorder is if you
want to taperecord 
ok 
well i have to go get dressed 
but i will brush your hair first and then put your shoes on 
yeah 
do not hold the microphone 
oh i will show you in a minute 
did you hurt yourself nam 
oh on the metal in this bed again 
yes my goodness 
well it is kind of sad yeah with the metal 
what i try to do usually is fi the mattress so the metal not
sticking out quite so much 
is it nice having a rug in nursery school 
the rug 
that make it nicer sitting over there 
nicer crawling place 
and kind of quieter too 
what why not get the shoe on first and then i will watch you 
i like to finish doing something when i start it 
it is always a good idea 
finish one thing 
what you going to do 
going to crawl 
oh wowie 
hopping on one foot 
oh that does look hard 
let me see if i can do it 
oh yeah oh it is too hard 
tricky 
oh you have really got to be able to balance awhile doncha 
oops 
but just even to be able to hop on one holding one foot like that
is really good 
ok 
i think he is back getting dressed 
you want to hold the microphone 
ok you can hold it just try not to move around too much 
now you want to say something special into it 
is that what you did the other day at school when you recorded 
did you hold the microphone 
or was the microphone on the table 
or did nam hold the microphone 
oh 
did it make you feel shy to have the microphone in front of your
face 
did it make you shy to have nam there 
no oh that is good 
because you would met nam before huh 
remember meeting nam at nam 
you do not 
the night we went to the children service at nam 
remember the person who sat net to me nam 
that was nam 
do not you remember that 
yes i thought you knew her from before 
what nam 
um that is um something about i guess it turns the microphone off if
you turn this off 
it is a way of turning it off 
um i guess i should put some No_More_Tangles on your hair should not
i 
you washed it last night 
oh well 
yeah i know 
you are supposed to talk while you have got it there you know 
what 
the wallpaper piece of wallpaper

what else did the children do with them oops 
mmhm 
uhuh did anybody do cutouts 
uhuh 
uhuh and i saw it 
mmhm 
different colors 
yeah as soon as i get your hair done 
well i think it wo not record if you do not 
we do not want to have one side of your hair with No_More_Tangles
and the other side not have because then you would have one tangles side
and that would be silly would not it 
and we would keep wondering hmm why is one side of your hair all
tangled and the other side nice and smooth 
you are going to what 
ok 
what are they  
ok want to listen to what it sounds like now 
ok there is just a little more tape left on nam not too much so
you can tape what is left ok 
ok 
i do not want you to push any buttons 
i will come back later 
do not push button ok 
nam you did not have your vitamins this morning did you 
let us just put this over here 
ok 
do you want me to open them or do you want to take them out 
ok

all+right there is just a tiny bit left on here not very much and then
the tape will be over 
i am going to put the bunnies up here ok 
i know 
i am just waiting 
i am not really watching 
i am just waiting for the tape to be over 
do you feel inhibited when i am here 
this is continuing from the other side 
this is February si and nam wants to finish her sentence 
ok now 
nam 
you do not have to hold the microphone actually that close to your
mouth 
hold a little further away and we will just hang the microphone over
the side here and you can play with your animals and stuff and still
record 
would you like to do that 
hmm 
ok 
you do whatever you want just do not push any buttons 
ok and try not to drop the microphone 
how is everything in here going nam 
please do not hold the microphone right up to your mouth nam 
if it gets wet inside there it is very bad for it nam 
so do not put it on your mouth 
hold it yeah about that distance away from you is fine 
yeah but it actually does not even need+to be held nam 
it could just be 
you can have it just hanging off the chair and then you have both
of your hands free to play and you would still be talking into the
microphone 
do not use the microphone like that nam your lips are on the
microphone 
remember to hold it away 
ok 
the reason is it does not record well and it ruins the microphone 
i will come in just a second nam

look on the side there 
i am sure you will find it 
the whole thing of what 
you will have a whole big stomach ache from it 
 
you will be sick for a week if you ate all those cookies 
you would 
you would not be coughing just you would have a terrible belly ache 
what is wrong 
let me see 
all+right 
nam eating 
that is what i am reading 
that is nam eating his ship ahoy cookies 
then a big phony appears 
and he wants those cookies collect 
here 
and then into a nearby telephone goes this guy nam 
and he comes out as cookie man 
and he beats up the big phony 
and he says 
if you got any hangups just think about shipahoys 
but cookies do not give you muscles nam 
good eercise gives you lots of muscles and eating the right food 
huh 
and let us see what happens 
now we will go i told you this afternoon you are going to go
grandma and auntie nam is going to come over with grandfather 
ok 
hmm 
because you have school tomorrow 
you ca not sleep over at grandma 
did not you just sleep over at grandmother nam house over the
weekend 
hmm 
yes 
right did not you 
did not you sleep over there 
hmm 
hmm 
you are not going to listen to me huh 
yeah the big phony 
right 
he turned him upside+down 
now in a minute we have to talk about 
he thought he was going to take the cookies 
eat them i guess 
i did that that is nam sitting down 
he is eating his cookies quietly by himself 
and suddenly this big guy comes along and he says 
i want your cookies 
same person huh 
right 
well maybe if he would asked please could i have one nam would
have given him a cookie but the phony said i want one he demanded
it and when you demand things what happens 
yeah that is right 
you know when people are polite and they ask certain things
certain in nice ways they get it 
right 
well 
that is what he wants some chocolate+chip+cookies 
well is not that his mouth there 
i do not know you will have to ask him 
the phony 
oh now you are being silly 
i want you to sit+up 
you heard me 
sit+up 
did you get to go up on the um 
the thing in your room 
you know the thing in your room in school 
the loft 
did you get a chance to go up this morning 
oh 
do not you go up when nam up there 
why not 
you just tell him that not to kick you 
that is all 
why are you why are you why are you going to do that to nam if he
has not done anything to you yet 
you do not start those things 
because if you start them and you throw yourself on him and hurt
him then he is going to want to hit you back because it hurts and he
gets sore 
you know i do not like that 
you know why b_ms belong in the bath tub bath tub in the toilet
bowl 
no place else and you should not be doing that for anybody or
wishing that on anybody 
i am serious 
i am really serious 
who 
nam 
what 
 
 you are always screaming 
maybe you can get some     did you ever think of doing that
d
then it will stand it up by itself 
huh 
no need for screaming when you get things done 
i told you that before 
just ask 
are you sure you do not want anything 
hmm 
you are not eating much of that sandwich 
so what 
when you went 
what did you do instead of going up to the loft then 
hmm 
you did not go up to the loft you said right 
so what else did you do 
yeah 
and how many other children were up there 
oh there was four 
you did not have to sneak up 
you can go up on the loft when you want to 
just no more than five children are allowed that is all 
huh 
uhhuh 
so you can go up there if there are only four children up there or
three children 
if there are five there you have to wait 
so what did you do instead of going up there 
hmm how did you play cards 
you mean hide them 
and what do you do with the cards then 
you take them into your hands 
did you know some of the numbers on the cards 
did you have to play numbers or guess numbers 
you just had to pick them and slap them down and pick it up 
into the middle 
who took out all the cards 
oh 
careful you are hurting him rob 
junior does not like it when you do that to him 
just be gentle with him if you pat him and talk to him 
well but you grab him by his tail he does not particularly like the
idea of it and he is only going to be howling 
you can have bananas whenever you wish 
might give you a bite of it but you can eat one 
you had one for breakfast this morning 
 save it until after dinner 
no i do not like tasting the paper 
just throw that in in the garbage 
yeah well you have had enough ice+cream 
you have had yours plus mine and this wrapper goes in the garbage 
you did not have any rest time or nap time at all

what did you do when you were playing 
what kind of play was it 
you went with the school to do this did not you 
no i do not 
in the market

this afternoon 
then where did you put that one

of crabs in there too

oh i think it had about eight feet nam 
about eight legs 
it would have an even number of legs so it could walk easily on
each side 
yeah that is why you did not pick it up 
i did not feel like picking it up either because i do not like crabs
d
yeah nam picked it up 
no she picked it up properly

if it is a nice day

would you like me to cook you some chicken wings 
uhhuh 
i do not think you will have room for both 
chicken wings if you eat enough of them are quite filling 
hmm i hope it is nice because if it is still raining or if it
rains late into the night the grass will be wet 
the grass will be too wet to sit on 
i think we should make plans to do something else just in case it is
raining 
hmm 
ha ha ha ha 
i am talking about the ground goes wet 
and sometimes some of the tents do not have floors on them 
then you get wet when you sit down 
uhhuh 
you will have to remind daddy to bring one home 
well you told me you wanted to set one up on the terrace did not you
d
the  has pup tents like the army the real small ones 
up at the armory 
well the men use them when they go away for a weekend 
when they go out camping in the woods 
well there are not any really bad things 
there is no snakes or bears 
because that is not the area for them 
you may find you may find a very small little stake snake but
not the big rattle snakes 
yes 
you are 
how would you go about doing that 
how would you go about killing a rattlesnake 
how 
no 
you can kick them but that the snake can bite you 
that is how a rattle snake kills you 
with his bite 
 and he has poison in his teeth and he lets go 
it travels through your body 
uhhuh 
it already made the bite 
you have to shoot a rattlesnake or possibly kill it with a knife 
well you will learn more about these things when you get to be a boy
scout 
what 
i do not think so 
how about the meat you eat 
and vegetables 
yes 
all the food that you eat most of the food that you eat 
well it means it makes your body the best it can be when you eat
the right foods 
that is why you have to eat your vegetables like the one here and
your salads 
eat salads they have they have some good vitamins in them 
and to help you see 
they make you good teeth strong teeth 
well hmm hmm 
yes 
just like warren are 
right 
teeth 
teeth 
you have many teeth 
he took out one tooth 
it is one tooth 
more than one tooth are called teeth 
teeth 
yes 
mmhm 
no when yours fall out then you will be about seven 
i guess you are about  yeah 
seven and eight they start 
fall out and you get new teeth coming in 
and they are 
because your soft your first teeth here loosen 
because up above you have another tooth growing and it wants to
push out the other one  this one falls out and you get a big
strong tooth coming out 
that is going to last you the rest of your life 
it just grows 
it grows up in the gum 
and all the milk and the juice the milk that you drink 
you eat 
it makes your teeth 
and the sunshine that you get makes your teeth very strong and
they grow in strong 
from up above in your gum 
uhhuh 
when these fall out when your first teeth fall out 
when your first teeth start to fall up in the gums 
and this happens to everybody when they are young 
um 
not all the time no 
you may have all you baby teeth fall out and you will have none of
them hurt you 
and right 
mommy doeandt need them to have any pain 
ecept when start to rock back and forth sometimes 
ecuse me 
it is hard to eat 
that is right 
no maybe they will come in 
mmhm 
as each tooth falls out 
the one that is growing in the gum comes down 
i do not know it just moves down nam 
hmm i do not know it just keeps growing out from the gum 
uhhuh are you sure you are going to be able to finish all of that

yes 
well daddy can tell you stories when he used to change clothes but
it was not too much fun 
in the army 
oh

that is another story altogether 
oh listen you have to call up nam tonight nam

maybe after dinner 
tomorrow morning maybe we will plan to do something like take you to
 out in the morning

yeah 
oh daddy loves beef 
with all the onions 
i meant to call up your mom and dad before i will call them well i will
call them up later 
yeah 
there is one thing that i do want to do tonight nam is when you
go in for your bath 
w a s h his h e a g 
you have to have your hair washed 
because it is dirty 
of+course with your soap 
well of+course with your soap 
who elses 
or do you want to take a shower tomorrow morning with daddy and
i will wash your hair then 
it is up to you 
you have a choice 
yeah 
you have a choice 
mmhm 
um 
ok so that means you get your hair washed tonight 
i wish we could you know nam that is what we have to do 
get him a small pair of goggles 
yeah 
probably would do 
i will go back out to sears where i got the ones i used for swimming
down in Florida 
that is all 
mmhm 
we are going to try and find another pair 
because these that thing is useless the one he has now 
i know i do too 
no it does fit 
it fits it too well 
it is too large it fits it is too big 
it may fit you for the net several years until you grow into it 
you should have seen nam when you gave them to nam 
yeah fits her perfectly 
um no it its loose like in the cheek areas 
 
so it probably fits nam 
but she was very ecited about it 
yeah i am sure it will fit nam 
or we could 
that is right nam is a big boy 
when you go to take him for his sneakers on saturday you are going
to take nam with you i assume 
um might not 
may i have the salt nam 
one more day 
after tomorrow you get your sneakers with taillights ok 
easy easy easy easy 
he is having a good time 
i know i i know you do i know i know you have been waiting for
this day for a long time 
 
i am going to jump right in there 
and put on my sneakers and ram all way home 
no you are not you are not going to run them all the way home 
you will ride in the car with daddy 
yeah 
but you will have a chance to use them 
mmhm come on so eat some meat and potato now 
no they are good 
they are good ecept no they are not too they are not good Ed
they are small on him now 
not the brown ones 
the brown ones are small on him 
the one that he bought are not the brown ones 
he bought the blue ones 
oh yes the blue ones still fit you 
the blue ones you will be able to wear 
mmhm 
i doubt if they would 
no not that is what mommy means 
mommy means that she does not think they will fit 
she agrees with you 
not disagrees mommy agrees with what you are saying 
she is agreeing with you 
they may not fit you either 
you may grow very large we may have to get you another pair 
mmhm 
plus when you grow up as you are growing up nam you grow very
very quickly and you grow in spurts 
when daddy was growing up in one year he grew si inches 
um mmhm 
yeah a long time before nam was 
rob please 
i want you to eat please 
mmhm 
that is right 
then you would be bigger than he but you were not so there is nothing
to talk about ecept that you are not eating your food 
no he will always be as twice as old as you are 
not twice mommy 
he will always four years older than he is that is all 
not twice 
oh that is right and i was talking about my dad 
no   
and when you are eight nam just going to be twelve 
that is right 
he will be siteen 
nam will be twenty 
then you and he probably could be friends because he will still only
be twenty four 
you might you may wind up being larger than nam nam because
mommy and daddy are bigger than his mommy and daddy 
because that is the way it is 
that way right young man please start eating 
you know we may have to have him ah checked out again 
you know he is picking at his tooth 
are you going up to nam on saturday too 
i do not 
i did not think you had an appointment 
not until net week 
ok 
we wer not talking about you nam we were talking about daddy
appointment at the dentist 
not your appointment you have no appointment with the dentist 
do you want any more beans 
no 
well maybe nam son will be there so you wo not have to
worry about it 
he is a good dentist 
well then both are good dentists 
sometimes a little bit 
well it even hurts daddy teeth when he do it

the ah

you know you are not eating 
well we will get up there once mommy finishes school and you finish
school we are going to be running around nam visiting

mmhm 
if you are not going to school is he going to go to camp this summer
d
i would like to put him in so i can study to take the am proficiency 
that is what i would like to do 
it would give me some time or hopefully 
now i will tell you what 
i doubt if it was siteen steps because i would not jump from
siteen steps 
well you jumped from four steps 
but 
and even then that is dangerous for you nam 
siteen steps are the distance from up on 
oh mercy oh mercy 
up over here to all the way down oh mommy 
to all the way down to nam 
oh it will be all+right because it was only on three hundred 
to nam level to where nam lives 
that is right 
that is how much siteen steps are 
yeah 
siteen is a big number 
yes siteen is larger than you are 
now 
because you are only four 
now start eating this 
si siteen will still be bigger than you

you should know the spot by now 
a little old woman and a little old man lived together in a little
old house and they were lonesome but they had no boys or little
girls to play with them 
because they had no children 
one day the old woman said i wanted a gingerbread boy 
so she made the man of gingerbread and popped him into the oven to
bake and then she sat down to rest 
yes 
the little woman peeked into the oven to see how the gingerbread
man was baking 
out of the oven he jumped and away he went down the road 
stop 
stop 
yelled the old woman 
stop 
stop 
yelled the little old man 
the gingerbread man laughed and called out 
and the little old woman and the little old man ran and ran 
they could not catch him 
so the gingerbread man ran until he met a cow 
stop said the cow i want to eat you the gingerbread man laughed
and called out again 
i ran away from the old woman and the old man and i can run away
from you i can i can the cow ran after him but she could not catch
him 
the gingerbread man ran on until he met a horse 
stop cried the horse 
i want to eat you 
the gingerbread man laughed and called out 
i ran away from the old woman the old man the cow and i can run
away from you 
i can i can 
and the horse ran and ran but he could not catch the gingerbread
man either 
soon the gingerbread man met some farmers 
stop called the farmers 
we want to eat you and the gingerbread man laughed and called out
again 
i ran away from the old woman the old man 
the horse yeah and i can run away 
the farmer ran and ran but they could not catch him 
the gingerbread man was really picking up speed 
and by and by the gingerbread man came to the river 
and there by the river was a sly old fo 
hello said the fo 
can i carry you across the river 
the gingerbread man looked at him 
do not worry said the fo 
i wo not eat you 
so the gingerbread man sat on the foes tail and away swam the fo
d
when they were half way across the fo said the river is deep here
my friend you had better get on my back 
so the gingerbread man go on the fo back 
soon the fo said the water is deep jump on my head 
the ginger bread man jumped on the fo head 
when they were almost across the fo said the water is deepest here
d
you had better jump on my nose gingerbread man 
the gingerbread man was afraid of the fo but he was more afraid
of the water 
so he climbed onto the foes nose 
the fo jumped ashore opened his mouth and snipped at the
gingerbread man arms 
snap    snip snap he was all+gone 
and that was the end of the gingerbread man 
but then the gingerbread man 
that is right

when we make our gingerbread cookies did they run off the table and
run out of here

because it is food to eat   
hmm

could not catch him 
and then he ran on until he met a cow 
stop called the cow

stop cried the horse i want to eat you 
the gingerbread man laughed and called out again 
i ran away from the old woman the old man and a cow 
and i can run away from you i can i can 
nam the gingerbread man is made for easter 
the only way to kill a gingerbread man is to eat him 
because you are eating it 
he is a cookie to be eaten and this story is just made up about a
gingerbread man

and there by the river was the sly old fo 
hello said the fo can i carry you across the river 
and the gingerbread man looked at him and said the gingerbread man
looked at the fo and the fo said to him do not worry i wo not eat
you 
so the gingerbread man sat on the fo tail and away swam the fo
d
when they were halfway across the fo said the river is deep here
my friend you had better get on my back 
so the gingerbread man hopped on the fo head 
soon the fo said the water is deep jump on my head 
the gingerbread man jumped on the foes head 
when they were almost across the room the fo said the water is
deepest here you had better jump on my nose gingerbread man 
mm the gingerbread man was afraid of the fo 
because he thought the fo might eat him 
but he was more afraid of falling in the water 
because he was 
he would he would dissolve in the water he would crumble 
you know when your cookies fall sometimes they fall into your cup
of juice 
what happens

before we go into this story let me read you the story of big Joe
d
ok 
this is big nam 
he is a truck driver 
he arrives at the truck lot early in the morning and he waits  
first big nam reports to the dispatcher to get his orders for the
day 
he finds out what he is going to carry in his truck and where he is
supposed to go 
and the dispatcher gives nam some maps and a time  
hmm 
d
hmm 
 
 
yeah they do not  show you the back of a truck like this 
in the back they have these lights 
the wires have to go over here that works the ones in the back so
that when he puts his foot on the brake what will happen 
that is right the lights go on 
they have to have it on all the time 
the only time that they are not down is when the truck this truck
is hooked up to the trailer 
if it is not hooked up these have to be here or the whole trailer
will fall down 
look 
come here i will show you 
look what happens 
can that stay up 
no it needs the front wheels right 
to hold it up 
and with the front wheels on 
it stands up 
right 
if i take the back wheels off what happens 
it falls down 
it needs the wheels 
yeah then we could not go anyplace 
ok 
that is so it makes it easier for them to drive the toys the boes
and the crates on to the trailer truck the trailer 
because there is a space 
the truck does not fit more than one  sometimes 
because it does not 
there is always a little bit of a there is a like when we go on a
train and you step off the train is not there a little space between
the train and where we were standing 
ok that is the same thing here 
so we put a little bridge since we that we can walk over

and when a trailer truck comes in they are going to pick this up

three 
the bill was five twenty 
what did you do 
then i had some change 
we had no intentions of going anywhere after the wake 
we come out we walked you know all around and i figured it is so
beautiful up there the fountain 
i keep meaning to go up there 
oh it is swell 
we come out 
i had taken the nam in 
as you come up from the nam it said no parking 
so you know we parked and said 
let us get out of here 
so we were in about two hours 
we come out and we could not find the car 
did you figure it was stolen 
we could not find the parking lot 
we come out the wrong door 
we come out 
the back and the front look eactly alike 
uhhuh 
you know they have got the big escalators to go up and everything 
we could not find the parking lot 
we are standing there killing ourselves laughing 
for an hour we kept walking up and down up and down 
my poor cousin nam was so sick 
she had an awful cold 
we dragged her all over the place 
her feet were killing her 
finally we come against a guard up front you know 
he said 
i wonthered what you three were laughing about 
we lost the car you know 
finally he said 
i do not know where you could have put it 
there is not any there is a little parking lot way down behind there
you go down then you go up and down 
he said 
the cars always get towed away and it will cost you eight dollars 
we did not even have ten cents to make a phone call 
we were hysterical 
finally we found the car 
it was still there 
it was the same parking lot 
yeah 
the towing away one 
yeah they did not tow ours anyway

three idiots walking up and down the sidewalk

nothing looked familiar 
we did not know where to go 
we went to the ladies room and we had a dime 
i had a dime and i gave it to nam 
she put the dime in the thing that you turn 
then instead of pushing it in she pushed it out and the dime went
down you know 
just then the matron come in

the matron said 
you you did not put a dime in

said 
well here is the dime 
nam 
by this time nam was tearing you know 
and nam said 
i do not want the dime 
but i put the dime in 
she said 
well she was right 
that is terrible 
they lose more money that way than by giving out a few dimes to
people who put things in just as a matter of principle 
yeah nam says 
i do not care about the old stinking dime but it was the only one
we had 
and she said we did not put it in you know

we were not supposed to be up there anyway up on the seventh floor
to look at the pool 
we pushed the button 
i do not know we pushed the wrong button 
it was the emergency button and bells were going to all over the place
d
we took off and left him standing there 
then we got locked in one of the rooms upstairs near the pool 
oh nam

i am not going to anywhere with you 
her and her bright ideas 
nam try holding it here and here and then you can move it wider 
see put your finger like this 
see how i hold it 
you are doing this and then you ca not you ca not hardly squeeze it 
put it more at the end of your fingers and then you can cut better
d

ya know 
i did not even think of that 
maybe if i held this and you pushed the screw 
let us try maybe another tool might do it

i think 
maybe try turning it the other way 
you will do it

i do believe it is going to come out 
you are so smart

you are a smart kid nam 
yeah

series 
do you know what a series is 
that means that this is one dinosaur 
in a bunch of a+lot different dinosaurs 
the the people who made this puzzle the people who made this kind
of puzzle have a nam and they probably have a Brontosaurus
a and they probably have a nam and a number of other
ones 
and you are have to listen 
ok 
is everyone paying attention 
yes 
that means watching me 
ok 
watching me and looking at me and listening to what i have to say 
which means everything has to be put down nam otherwise you are
not paying attention to me and you are not going to know how to play
the game 
i put this down before  
now put everything back on the clothes line put everything back on
the hanger 
nam look what i have 
ok now put everything down 
ready 
i am going to read the  i am going to read the directions for this game
now 
it is called 
hang ups 
right 
it is called this name this game is called hang ups because we are
using you know what 
hangers 
we are using hangers 
and what do you hang with hangers 
what do you hang up with hangers 
clothes 
ok and then these are hang ups too 
yeah 
but what do we have up with these 
clothes 
right 
wet clothes 
and what do we do here in the classroom 
what do we hang up here 
d
right 
ok so this is why this this game is called hangs ups because
we are using a hanger and clothes pins 
now 
hang ups it says 
look 
sit down with some children around a table 
i do not want any talking 
right 
i am going to read this once and then i am going to discuss it 
ok 
sit down with some children around a table 
ok 
each player get a wire clothes hanger on which there are si
clipped clothes pins 
everyone rolls a dice a die 
ok 
when you have one it is called die 
when you have two when there is more than one it is called dice 
everyone rolls a die to see who goes first 
the child who rolls the highest number starts 
he throws the die how many 
one 
get up and walks clockwise around the table 
ok 
clock wise around the table in the way in which a clock runs 
right 
like when you look at the clock 
right 
here we are got a clock 
right 
and here is twelve oclock and then you go right what is after this
d
one oclock here is two three four five si seven eight
nine ten eleven 
four five si seven eight nine ten eleven 
which direction did i go in 
d
right 
i went in this direction 
right because the numbers went one two three four five 
that is called clockwise because i was going in the direction of the
clock 
one two three 
so if you look at so if i count it goes look one two three four
five si seven eight nine ten eleven twelve 
that is my circle this is called clockwise ok 
this way 
d
if if we are looking here this is how it looks 
i like the cups you see like 
ok 
it is in a circle 
yeah 
but clockwise means going this way 
because you can on you can only go in this direction too right
d
so we are going in this way to our right 
and like this 
right like this 
like a garbage can 
and like a  
ok that was 
d
so it says he throws the die gets up and walks clockwise around
the table taking one clothes pin from from each player until he
has collected the number shown on the die 
then he hangs his collection on his own hanger the same 
so nam you throw we will break the tie the other four ok Greg
you have to be four 
so you  and nam goes first 
three 
ok nam goes first 
now nam you go first 
if we are going the same direction as the as the numbers on the
clock 
look at  
no he is not doing anything right now 
so nam goes first then nam nam nam and then nam 
now nam wait wait a minute 
ok you threw a three 
you are going to put the three down 
ok i said wait 
nam threw three so she is going to walk around the table to three
people to three people and for each 
and i go to four people 
because no you have to wait until you throw the dice again 
she it says three so she walks this way to three people and from
each person she takes one clothes pin 
so you leave yours on 
hey 
this way 
first clockwise in the same direction as the clock 
hey let me have one 
nam give nam one 
any you give her any one you want
