sure they do 
uhhuh 
uhhuh right here where the feathers go 
is that the front or the top 
oh where feathers are is the bottom hhmm 
uhhuh 
uhhuh so you have to be very careful with them right 
is that how you want it 
ok 
how that 
ok 
you thought of what last night 
oh to make arrows 
when did you think about it 
oh did you have a dream about it or were you just thinking 
oh you were just thinking huh 
were you sleeping while you were thinking 
oh 
i do not know we will find somebody 
what did you think 
i am going to be little nam 
when you were thinking last night what were you thinking with 
uhhuh 
what 
that book 
what 
he taped that page 
oh that was a long time ago 
what did they pass by 
what did they pass by 
you want to shoot it 
ok you grab this 
and you put this here 
and then you shoot it 
ok oh hey 
the scab came off your lip today does it feel ok 
good if you need ointment on it let me know do you want me to make
	a target and you can shoot at the target 
make the target stand up 
she was happy when the scab came off 
mommy said that when she started to leave 
oh when she started to leave for school tonight 
how about a piece of candy 
ok here you go 
what happened 
did you cross the street by yourself 
which street 
at the zoo today 
well you know you should wait for mom ok 
her did not she did not come so you went by yourself 
well you should wait for her it is real dangerous crossing the
	street so even if we are not there you should wait for us ok 
you did look 
yeah cept there were no cars good how that 
you sure can 
that is pretty good 
look you hold it like this 
you grab the string like this 
put the arrow in here like this 
sure 
not quite far enough here i will hold the target closer you need a
	lot of practice to be like nam do not you 
ok here we will put the target right here 
and you can come sit in my lap and i will help you do you need some
	ointment on your sore 
ok do not pick at it now 
oh put one hand here put the other hand here and you rest this on
	top 
are you ready 
when i say 
let go 
let go ready 
set go oh pretty close huh 
it is hard to make a hole we will have to get a special type of target
	ok 
are you ready to shoot another one 
tell me when you are ready 
ok wow 
we knocked the target off did not we 
ok 
i will get my legs up i do not want no alligator to bite my toes 
ok i will hold the target for you 
ok did you get him 
say would you like a sword 
would you like a sword 
yeah do you remember what a sword is 
what a sword 
would you like a sword 
oh you like your bow and arrow and that is enough 
we need+to make something to keep your arrows in do not we 
i bet mommy could make something 
me too 
what 
what is 
show me again 
oh the quiver to keep the arrows in 
a quiver that is called a quiver i think i am not sure i will have to
	find out but i think it is called a quiver 
what 
bring me your brown bag your mailman bag 
see it on the floor over there 
know what we could do 
we could put the arrows in here and pretend this is a quiver 
and make a quiver 
i do not think we want to cut this up mommy made this look what does
	it say 
it says mail bag 
we could use this as a quiver 
what is he doing 
your bunny 
let us see it is i did not know that 
oh did you tell her too 
ok set it up and we will shoot it 
what 
what 
oh you picked the rest of your scab off 
let us put some ointment on that ok 
here we go 
yeah nam has a bow and arrow just like yours are you glad i
	made that for you 
the bow 
this is a bow those are arrows and that is a quiver 
you think we could make a feather out of paper 
yeah we could color it 
ok is that a good looking feather 
i have to cut it out first ok 
i am not 
so i can look at it when i draw 
good idea ok where the scissors 
i know but i am going to use them for a second ok 
they are 
if these are too little how come i am using them 
if i am using them are they still too little 
are you sure 
oh i can not use them 
you know what 
this is not quite sturdy enough i know we have some poster board
	that would really make a sturdy feather would not it 
where my pen at 
here it is 
what 
we could could not we 
i do not know if that would work though i think that it would be
	better if mommy made it out of cloth what do you think 
is this a good feather 
so you think we could make the quiver out of paper too 
let me see if i can use your scissors they are not too small 
two fingers in at one time 
i do not need+to because my fingers are pretty big see 
do you put two fingers in 
ok you show me how you put two fingers in oh i see Two fingers in
	one and your thumb in the other let us see how this feather looks
	wow: That fine looking feather 
should we tape it 
ok 
there you go why do not you go look in the mirror 
what happened 
the mirror that you got at easter got lost 
is there another mirror that you can look at 
why do not you look and see if you like your feather 
you like it 
do you want an orange quiver 
all we have to do is cut the know out 
know they are too big for two to go in but they work fine with one
	in each hole 
would you like it like that 
or a square 
ok god you sure do look like nam 
that string you found is good 
take the knot out 
you think mommy had a good idea huh 
when did she have that idea 
right before she left 
do you mean take the knot out 
or untie the knot 
ok 
yeah see 
we have to get the bottom fied and we are in good shape 
do you think it is going to work all+right 
it is almost ready 
ok just a second i have to finish this ok let me see the knot what
	are you going to do when you get all this stuff 
that is a good idea 
i think so 
tie it to your chin 
i can fi it so it will not fall down without tying it to your chin 
i do not know we will have to find somebody 
nam downstairs 
ok you have to start all over 
huh 
ok remember 
the square goes in the corner 
this one goes right net to the square and the long side goes net
	to the other long side 
uhhuh 
uhhuh i think you are right 
where does it look like it should go 
no 
uhhuh 
with the long edge you have to get the long edges together no
	that is not the long edge 
here let us feel them all this one long and this one long that is
	the longest one 
uhhuh see dad he did it 
he sure did 
do you want to try it again all by yourself this time 
i will help you just if you need help i would like to watch you do it all
	by yourself 
uhhuh 
uhhuh 
uhhuh 
uhhuh 
uhhuh 
uhhuh 
and look what you have made that is pretty clever 
why of+course 
i have a game to play if you want to

i did not hear what you said daddy was talking to me 
i would say 
nam a giraffe needs a home 
i would say 
nam this giraffe needs a home he likes tall trees 
and then what would the giraffe say 
i know what they could do they could both get on the same boat and
	go back to nam

	upon+top+of the square and i get a small triangle and put it here i
	get a diamond and a triangle

uhhuh 
well you know if you do not like that color you can put yellow or
	green or purple 
ok

i am ready i have got to draw on it first 
you want to make a puck right 
how big should a puck be 
ok pucks are round right 
and i have got a compass do you know why

we do not have to draw on the inside after we cut it out you can
	paint it ok

that is a popsicle mold are you going to watch me do dishes 
did you play with coffee cans at school today 
did you play with coffee cans at school today 
what did you do with them 
did you really 
i have some empty coffee cans do you think you could show me how to
	make a drum 
ok what equipment do you need 
paper what else 
what 
tops 
and what else 
you do not need glue or paste or anything 
is this too large 
you do need glue 
ok here this is a good size let me see if we have a top for it boy
	i can really smell that bread 
looking for a top to this coffee can it apparently got lost somehow
	
yeah do you have everything 
colors 
do you need the scissors 
ok what else do you need 
paste or glue 
ok what else 
do you want this sandwich 
ok show me what to do i would really like to learn how to make a drum 
are you sure you do not color it first 
ok 
oh 
uhhuh 
now i see that is really clever nam do you see how nam doing this
	
making crisscrosses show daddy 
that is good 
ok what do you do with the paste 
on the back 
i see say do you think that before we put the paste on we ought to
	measure the paper and see if it is too long 
look it is a little too long 
do you want to get the scissors and cut it before we put it on we
	will not be able to put it on the floor because the paper sticking
	out and we will not be able to put the top on because the paper will be
	in the way do you think we ought to cut it 
ok let me get the scissors 
ok let me cut it and then you can put the paste on 
i already did 
look this paper was too long and too short see it does not meet so
	what we have to do is put this here and then paste it in two places
	see 
like that 
i have to measure it 
i think at school you must have had premeasured paper that would
	really make it easier is that what happened 
ok i think we are all set 
ok yes it fits now 
uhhuh we will have to wash them off when we are through 
you do not think we need paste 
who said that 
nam did 
or did she say that you do not need glue 
oh it looks like you have done a good job putting paste on there do
	you think you have enough 
let us try this and see and you do it this way 
you just wrap it around 
it looks almost like a roll of toilet paper does not it 
it fit nam now what do you do with the top 
you just put it on like that 
what a neat drum it is pretty 
oh that is a nice drum

that way we can break it instead of sawing all the way through ok
	your turn 
what 
oh do you want me to help you 
sawing is pretty hard work 
ok let me try it 
i think we will just try and break it

does daddy 
uhhuh 
nam bring the bo over here you can help me ok 
hold this hold it real tight are you holding it 
huh 
a ring

oh i see 
i will not i am doing my best ok 
are you holding it for me 
you have to hold it tight we did it 
he sure to sand it down 
i will 
where the gun at

i got all the ones that go to this one 
i am going to have to empty some of that water out 
just do not worry about it ok 
help with what 
sometimes if you put a+lot of pressure on it it will stick 
no i did not if you are going to be so particular nam we can put it
	up and do it another day 
i am sorry 
you are putting that upside+down 
nam you can not leave them in there that long that takes all the glue
	off and it will not stick just leave it in the water for a second ok 
do you understand now 
ok 
i have already taken all of these off 
ok we will do this one after we finish this one ok 
look the gentleman rides one way the lady rides another way and the
	farmer rides this way 
ok we have to find out what the farmer is carrying 
what 
let me see i guess they just want you to use your imagination and
	put those wherever you want to that is a pretty good idea 
sure that is a good idea 
that is fine let us go ahead and put the stickers on first so we
	do not lose the stickers ok 
here it is i already picked it up 
it looks like a proud horse does not it 
that one looks like a proud horse 
this one looks sad 
uhhuh 
he looks real proud to me 
daddy have you ever seen a horse cry 
a couple times 
i am sure they can feel sad sometimes 
oh 
no i think it will fit you have to put it in the water first 
just for a second get it out 
fast as what 
who is that 
hi nam 
i was just pretending that he could talk 
that one ok that is a good place to put the bird 
where do birds fly 
uhhuh

how come 
uhhuh that is where they get the best fertilizer 
breaking it 
peeling it 
like a banana 
let us see he the farmer what do farmers grow in their gardens 
uhhuh that is a carrot 
ok that is a good idea do you want to do this one 
ok let us see if we can find that page here it is 
because she a girl and girls are always queens if you are a boy
	you have to be a king 
right 
why of+course 
the king 
we will have to look at the picture before we can decide 
ok what he holding 
oh come on what is it 
uhhuh or an oar 
a oar 
it can be an oar or a paddle 
no it will work that looks like Doc in the nam 
he has old glasses on and so everybody called him Doc 
how can you tell he fat 
people who are fat have beards 
or do you think that he looks fat because he has big cheeks 
what 
do you think so 
well you should not tell her that because it might make her feel sad
	
i know i am glad you are telling me instead of her hurry 
before it dries 
no that was fast as the lightening 
how come 
he lost a finger 
uhhuh we do not have to call him a loser we could just tell him that
	he made a booboo 
oh

ok first of all we have to clear off the table so we will have a
	place to do it 
green 
just a second i will help you 
you do not 
what are you going to try to do 
do not rip them up 
because then we will have to get tape and tape them down 
the little lines are under there 
the little lines are under there 
do you want me to help 
with that pie 
ok 
well that is ok your hands will grow and the rest of your body will
	grow 
then you will die

what 
a nam 
to blot it 
why are you going to use a nam 
uhhuh i think that you have blotted it enough 
no 
oh 
last night 
i think that you are leaving them in the water too long and all the
	glue coming off do not leave it in the water so long ok 
ok but do not leave the stickers in the water so long and we will not
	need+to tape them ok 
no i think that is enough see it stayed on 
uhhuh 
no that does not need+to be blotted it does not have any ecess water
	does it 
uhhuh 
look and see that is right 
why 
probably because you forgot to do something 
you tell me 
no what about putting it in the bowl 
can not do what 
those are for another page 
those stickers are for another page we do one page at a time 
right here see 
that is a hard one

	it 
i think that rock and that stick are too big for a spear nam 
wow that is going to be hard to find when did you see that 
when did you see the other rocks 
how would it get buried 
no it is too heavy one thing about spears is that it should be
	carried real easy 
that is not the right kind of spear do not you want to have the right
	kind 
you silly goose maybe we could find a stick and a rock to make you
	a spear 
yeah 
i can not make that one work 
it will not work 
stick the rock where 
i think that you could probably find a better rock 
maybe later 
yeah but it is too wide 
you want it what 
you just want to be difficult do not you 
where are you going 
huh 
yeah that would be a good size this rock is too big it is too big to
	tie onto this stick 
or we could just look for another rock 
we can not dig nam 
the people would get mad at us 
maybe somebody else found that rock and took it home 
hmm 
oh then how are we going to find it 
i heard a car drive up i wonder if that is grandmother and grandfather 
oh 
yeah 
no 
no it is light brown 
that is not wood is it 
you need wood to make a spear 
what 
i already have 
it has to be straight first 
i can not throw it away 
what 
what 
what 
i do not know if they will let us dig for it 
because they are working and they might not want us to mess up the
	ground 
what if we can not find that rock 
ok 
no not now i have to go take a shower remember 
which would you rather have 
a spear or a lantern 
we have to wait for grandmother and grandfather if they came and we were not
	here what would they do 
you do not think they would be real disappointed 
it means they would be real sad 
what 
but who would be home if grandmother and grandfather come

is not it on your boohelf 
ask your dad that is his area 
i am not sure nam how do you think they learn 
i think you are right nam do babies try to learn how to talk or do
	they just learn without trying 
right i think you are right again does somebody teach babies how to
	talk or do they just learn how to talk 
are you sure 
i see 
the one we were looking for last night 
go get the book and we will look for it

which one 
the one we are looking for or this one

yeah that would really be something 
why 
oh that is right 
nam 
what would we do if we got all those bones 
huh 
that is right 
well this is the only picture 
i think this is the only one 
where

to see if we can find that picture is this it 
this 
a+lot of what ones 
here it is 
is it a skeleton 
i have looked through every page and i could not find it 
what 
maybe the page got ripped out 
is that him

sometimes he does is this it 
i think it might have been in a different book 
nam 
rember when we went camping with nam and nam

these we put into here 
these are wings and we are putting them into the clip

	airairplane 
it is not easy

now you turn the propeller many times 
ok let us try it

the tail 
the rudder

mmhm 
i heard it 
that is the place to attach the dart to the propeller 
no 
why 
it thought your arm was a tree 
why did it think that 
you did not hold it up high enough 
first you wind it many times 
then you hold it here and here and let go 
d
nam would not know what to do with an airairplane 
i do not think i would nam because it is not very strong 
you will not cut your finger what 
oh yes when it snaps 
that is a strong rubber band

that is all there is 
ok now everybody want to go to sleep now 
sure 
goodnight darlings 
i told nam that it was not would not be fair to cry just because i am
	giving a nam to another boy that is nam uh he should not cry
	because it makes me think that he does not want the other boy to have
	something nice 
and what did you say then nam 
actually he said 
well just think what if you had gotten the last one for him 
you know the set up of the double hypothetical just think what if
	
uh and 
i never could have gotten one 
how would that have happened nam 
oh i see 
i see 
you think it might have worked that way 
mhm 
i see 
now a little earlier you told me that you were pretty sure that the
	nam was for you 
and why did you think that 
and i would not and you said i would i  
daddy you would not have hided it you would not have hid it 
you said 
you would not have hided 
or 
would not have hid if it had been for me 
is not that what you said 
how did you say it nam 
because it was yours i would have hid it away 
do you think it is somebody else 
why do you think that 
no no 
ok but you but you thought you say that you think it is for you 
why do you think it is for you 
and why did you think so in the first place 
what was the reason 
no and the reason was no the reason was that you said that i did not
	tell you who it was for 
f it was yeah if it  if it was  if i was hiding it from you
	then it was sure to be yours because if it was for nam i would not
	try to hide it would i 
uhhuh 
so do you still think that reasoning is good 
do you still think that is that is good thinking or have you changed
	your mind now 
who do you think it is for 
uhhuh 
if it is for nam then why not show it to you right 
then i do show it to you 
uhhuh 
well i am not going to show it to you so what does that mean 
you you think now it is for you 
are you sure of that 
maybe i am just hiding it from nam 
so you think that is a pretty good uh ok 
so what how do you feel about it 
who it for at this point 
who would you guess 
who would you guess if you had to guess 
is it for nam or for nam 
you are not sure now 
now daddy keeps on telling you it is for nam right 
so you can not make up your mind can you 
well it is tough is not it 
what 
no way 
daddy are not spposed to tell 
daddy are never supposed to daddy 
how do you know that 
mhm 
you know something nam 
you are right 
you are right 
it is for you 
yes 
it is 
it is for you 
you guessed it 
because if i hide it there no way that i would hide something
	that is for nam if it is for nam why should i hide it right 
the only reason i should hide it is because i do not want you little
	kids to see it 
you got it right 
you got the right answer 
yes son 
what 
nam 
yeah i know the whole story 
it is the first book of Tron before there was Tron

hat part of the whole that is part of the the trilogy

	water and leftover spaces and stuff like that and you could look for
	sanddollars that just washed up

nam i will tell you something 
you can not 
what we have to do is you have to finish up your corn with me
	so you can have dessert 
i do not mind your not eating any meat but you have to finish your
	corn ok

	of your food before you do that 
well then you just can not be hungry enough 
i am sorry

um a little bit more 
ah i will probably wait 
hhmm

and uh 
so i i talked it over with nam who called up a couple of days
	after nam and i discussed it  on something else 
and said you know i would be more than happy to 
use this connection 
use this connection to set up the meeting but it would look a
	little silly seeing as he personally had been invited down twice 
hunm 
uh you know 
and uh why did not he get on the ball and just sorta tell the guy
	he was coming down 
and nam said in fact he was going to Jacksonville anyway in two
	weeks and would call him

	spoon it out si 
well it was running in 
see all these little holes in the tracks down here 
when you cut the meat the juice runs out of the meat into that
	little track there 
runs down until it gets to that hole 
blew up

that is the way rivers and lakes work 
look at that  
fantastic 
wow

and chocolate cake 
wowie 
where are the candles 
id you  your dessert i mean your soup

you had the candles yesterday remember

nam if yesterday was nam was your birthday what day was it 
d
but it was nam what 
nam sith 
you remember 
you bet you 
school day 
it was also a school day that is true 
you are going to lick all that ice+cream off that cake 
and then it will not be as good 
then he will not have to eat the cake 
mmhm 
when i took this in to school you should have heard the teacher
	lamenting as they would throw away plateful of of cake after
	plateful of cake 
it was just 
mmhm 
as far as i can tell kids are just not big cake and ice+cream
	eaters 
hhmm four 
an old myth eleven 
delicious 
delicious and what else 
scrumptious 
and what else 
cute 
d
what else goes with delit 
delicious is part of like delish 
and what goes with delish 
huh 
scrumptious 
what about nutrish 
delish  nutrish 
remember that 
d
no 
no 
not that one 
i think that is a dodism anyway is not it 
hhmm 
it might be 
i am not sure about that point 
i had the usual conversation with nam about whether or not they
	apparently i forget why 
she and nam stayed up until one thirty or two last night discussing
	whether or not they would have children 
and what their prioritys was and what they wanted out of their
	lives and what kind of people they was and  got to me 
d
that is pretty heavy 
i said if you have to really start really considering it it is
	impossible to make that kind of decision you know 
you looked cheery and healthy this morning 
d
you think that would make me look sick and ill 
well probably 
twelve 
all the questions that you feel that you probably ought to ask but
	most people do not on how why am i bringing these childs into the
	world 
uhhuh 
and what kind of life do i hope for them 
d
yeah 
i said  
shh i had had my heart had not been so uh heavy with nam 
i would have enjoyed the opportunity to discuss with her her attitude
	toward family planing and population control 
do you think she has a strong 
well it is funny that for for a person who makes a point of
	dedicating herself to the solution of human problems etcetera uh
	is to some degree 
that is true 
n idealist  uh to say you should be unrestrained in your in the
	reproduction of your species because essentially it is fun which was
	what her defense was 
having kids is 
d
a source of satisfaction to the parents 
not necessarily that it was uh good for the kids or anything else 
that that they was a comfort in their old age and so forth 
d
what she was saying to me was  hhmm having kids  having more
	than one more than two even is ok if you are if you are the rich
	and privileged class essentially 
d
but that is terribly elitist 
because how long does she epect uh people to be members of the
	class in which they presently find themselves 
let us say you know a generation down the road may be two or three
	
i mean 
ya know you have your nam familys and stuff like that 
uh you look at 
ya know there was a thing in Time magazine this week on descendants
	of the uh of the original founding fathers 
d
and they are plumbers an and whatever you know 
mmhm 
mmhm 
uh and there no guarantee that that  when you are talking
	about a problem the consequences of which  are not really going to be
	 
well they will be felt immediately 
but if you are talking about 
but i think she  
a problem that is going to become critical in say one more
	generation or two more generations 
mmhm 
by which time you have no reason to epect that your progeny are
	going to have the same 
values 
well or the or the same resources that you are going to have to bring
	up their childs as uh  
but what she assumes is that your progeny 
non dependents 
are much brighter than than the average nam brightness 
ok that that in itself is false 
even if they are brighter it does not mean that they are going to be
	economically self sustaining 
and even if they are economically self sustaining they are going to
	take up space and they are going to compete for resources with everybody
	else 
they are going to buy you know 
what was before the family uh  the family acreage on Nantucket 
we are going to split between the three 
that is ok nam 
male heirs or however they decide to split it 
i agree but  your speaking from the conservationist point of
	view and it would be interesting to hear 
well e even even from a uman uh from an aesthetic point of view in
	which she want 
ink there some supposed to be what twice as many people in the
	by the year two thousand or something like that 
does she want that 
i do not know whether she 
it seems to me she taking very much in the attitude of 
i find pleasure in it right now and it is somebody else problem
	later 
you think that is the way she viewing it 
think she caught in a funny position in that she now very much
	of a a women movement member 
hhmm 
but where she spent her life bringing up her childs and doing
	nothing but bringing up her children 
uhhuh 
until they was high school age 
mmhm 
you can not really say that was a total waste of time 
mmhm 
first of all she does not believe it 
yeah 
secondly she does not want to believe it 
yeah 
see what i am aiming at is that arguments for population control
	do not say that uh that bringing up childs is a waste by any means
	
mmhm 
huh 
yeah 
it acknowledges the fact that childs are you know a rare and 
	unique pleasure 
d
and so  it is just like a+lot of other rare and unique pleasures
	like driving a twelve cylinder car at eighty miles an hour 
at times you just can not do it in a world of finite resources 
it seems to me that you uh 
i can understand two but more than two no matter how talented and
	clever you may think you are 
if you are talented and clever enough to feel those people who
	are not will have too many childs then you have to more than make up
	for your share  too many 
ell that is another thing 
it just gets a little funny because first it is distinctly 
ya know people say that 
hey hey hey hey 
uhhuh 
hey you 
that is no good 
if you do not want to eat it that is ok too 
but i do not want you playing with it 
no good to play 
ya know what a good thing to eat with 
um your spoon 
spoon is very good for cake 
spoon is much better for cake for you five 
what she epresses a+lot of concern for and seems to have a
	genuine concern for is reflected in the programs in the Y and so
	forth 
ya know the the disenfranchised the disadvantaged the poor the
	needy and so forth and so on 
uh and then she turns around and says that uh 
you as members of the upper middle class should not restrain from
	having children because yours are going to be yours are going to be 
ut they should 
ecause P_r are 
yeah 
i mean that is the obvious implication 
it is 
it is true 
which which strikes me as you know  elitist in the etreme 
well it is 
you are quite right seven 
it makes her so obviously contented 
that 
uhhuh 
may eplain why she has so much trouble getting along with the
	people she 
has to deal with 
i hate to say that i go both ways 
not so much on the issue of of um 
having more than two but when i talk to her i am she or somebody
	like her and they say you should have more 
what fun it is i find myself saying right that is great 
first i have to clean you off 
would you wait here 
hey 
what up 
you do not want any 
i think you have enough on your shirt to last you through a long
	cold winter 
let us see your face 
hey you know what would happen if i were not holding on to this
	chair 
and you were climbing up on it like that 
you would fall on your nose

is this the way our car works 
hmm i wish it were that easy 
what in here 
oh the motor 
why do not we take all the wheels off and see what happens 
you know what 
yeah you know what makes that easier 
watch this 
see 
if it is really stuck in there you can use a screwdriver 
well if you can do if you can do it with your hands why use a
	screwdriver 
right 
sure 
they uh seem to have fallen by the side of the  the road there 
now that is when you use a screwdriver 
see how hard it is to work with your fingers 
see how you can not move it 
you put this in here 
now turn it 
whoops 
yeah ah  you did it 
yeah 
that is right 
you have one more to go 
now are you going to be able to get them all back on again 
that is the question 
oh you are not going to put them back on 
you just going to leave them a big mess 
oh ok 
i think you want to take this wheel off too 
i do not know 
screwdriver 
then you can take the bumpers off and you can take the seats out 
there you go 
yeah 
do you know what we use the wrench for 
where the wrench 
well i think if i can  
see 
if you put this 
do you know what this is called 
what for 
look at that 
that is a wrench 
see  
oh you know what that is 
i think that is the jack 
the jack is for 
you put that under the car when it is got a flat tire like now and
	it holds the car 
put that under the car 
like this i think 
ah ha and now we can put the wheel back on if we want to 
oh you do not want to ok 
you are huh 
you would not even help me put this car back together again 
oh 
but you do not want you do not want to help me with the car anymore

you will not help me at all 
nam 
uh+oh 
something wrong in here nam 
what am i doing wrong 
oh i see 
ah ha maybe i can tighten it up with a screwdriver can i do that 
ah 
but now the wheels do not turn 
you know the trouble with this car nam 
if you tighten up the wheels they do not turn 
cause it gets too tight 
they do not have any bearings 
that is the problem with that 
what do you think these two people are thinking about here 
who driving in there 
why is that person driving 
because he me 
who this person 
is that mom 
where nam 
in there 
whoop 
he is in there 
but you know what 
he can not see out very well 
because there no window there should we open it up and let him
	see 
who in there with nam 
is that nam right there 
like a nam person 
ok who else would we put in there with nam 
do you want to have someone in there with you 
nam ok

nam will like that 
where a place for nam 
well we will just put nam right here 
ok 
nam and nam together 
and we will close it right up again 
oh open it up 
oh i see 
it is going to make it hard to drive that way because now now daddy
	can not see where he going 
but that is all+right 
who cares right 
now where now where where are we going to go in this car 
oh how can he drive without the wheel 
do you want to try and put that back in for me 
huh 
you need+to screw it on 
well here a screwdriver 
why do not you use it 
here a screw 
you do not want to 
i do not want to either 
so one of us is going to have to do it 
i will put it right here 
let me see 
i think we will save that one for later ok 
where is this car going nam 
where should we go in this car 
if we were going to take a ride with you and nam+and+mom+and+me
	where would we go 
to the grocery store

oh that is a zero 
oh that is my turn 
each of these is a turn 
i see 
so you have a two turn and a ten turn 
that is a hard number i bet you do not know that one 
five and zero 
when you see five and zero together it is a fifty 
two 
what that one 
what this one here 
whoops 
how about that one right there 
zero 
you are not playing huh 
the the 
what other house oh i think you have done this before 
ah this is a book 
want to read it 
ha ha 
what is this about 
The_great_cat_chase well 
once upon a time 
there was 
uh what is that 
a lady with a cat 
she looks like a 
those clothes look too big for that lady 
i think maybe she borrows her mommy clothes 
what do you think 
yeah 
is that a possibility 
uh+oh what happening here 
can you tell what happened 
the cat running out and hiding 
that mischievous cat 
and she picking a flower 
and i think she all ecited and alarmed right here 
oh where my cat she says 
and who this over here 
he hiding he a mischievous cat 
and here we have 
what is she saying now to that person 
huh 
what who is that do you think 
a police+officer 
and what do you think she saying to the police+officer 
where my cat 
help help where my cat 
who this guy 
he a boy 
but he wearing 
what kind of boots 
cowboy boots on his tricycle 
all of a sudden everybody says 
hey who that 
who did they find 
the cat 
do we have a name for this cat 
no 
shall we give it one 
no 
you do not want to give it a name 
how are you going to call it if you do not know what his name is 
you say 
here 
here  here kitty kitty 
ok 
uh+oh and now look what happening 
what happening here 
you know what that little boy got on 
well look on his tshirt 
who that 
nam that is just like you can not it 
and i think this police has fallen flat on his nose trying to catch
	that cat 
kalunk 
and then they are going along in the woods 
and suddenly 
the cat goes into a big pipe to hide 
and then 
uh+oh 
i see trouble 
cause you see what happening here 
all these guys the police+officer and the lady are going in this end of
	the tunnel 
and if it comes out the other end then they are going to fall into
	the water 
and the cat sitting up here and the cat going to laugh 
ah that is right 
he nam 
and i think it is going to turn out that he knows better than the
	rest of them how to do this 
what do you think 
do you think he going to be the hero of this story 
uh+oh what happened here hmm 
can you tell me what happened 
that is right 
he fell into the water 
splush 
and there goes that old cat 
you see he trying to help her out of the pipe 
and she falls down and kaplunk they both go into the water 
what a mess 
and now they are really getting wet 
and the cat is jumping back in the pipe and going right back where
	they came from 
and what are these people saying 
i do not know 
what are they saying 
you do not know what they are saying 
i think they are saying 
stop you pesky cat 
you are driving us crazy 
we are going to catch you 
so then the lady and the police+officer are putting their clothes back
	on 
and they crawl into the pipe 
and look at the other end 
who turned out to have caught the cat 
the boy 
that is because little boys often know how to do things better than
	big people can not that right 
hmm 
especially if they are nam 
oh 
then he put the cat right on the police+officer head and the lady is
	grabbing the little boy by the ear 
and what do you think she telling him 
i think she saying something like um 
that was not a very nice thing to do 
but he after all caught the cat 
so why should she complain right 
and then the cat is about to go up the tree 
yeah and  
look he scratched the police+officer face off 
and then the police+officer trying to catch the cat 
and here he got him 
what do you think the cat 
do you think that cat looks happy 
he looks mad 
the cat did not want to get caught did he 
i think the little boy likes the cat too 
and the lady  
huh 
uh+oh 
what happened 
he falling down 
crash 
the whole tree broke i think 
look here 
you can see where it breaks 
and now the man falling down out of the tree 
oh and that poor 
what the cat so unhappy about 
the cat all+right 
oh and here the here the boy going home on the in the baby
	buggy 
and the police+officer limping home 
and the cat just following right along behind him 
and then here the lady 
and she telling them something 
i wonder what she saying to them there

he went into the sewer this cat 
and they went into the sewer after it 
an the kitten on the other side watching them go through 
what that 
a shoe and his pants huh 
that is underneath his costume 
and then he comes out of the sewer 
and the cat just watching them huh 
and then he runs away 
they look very unhappy do not they 
more huh 
oops did you know what they are in nam 
what that 
do you know 
they are in the water

i think that is what they are in 
and he helping her get out 
and they fall straight in the water altogether do not they 
look how happy the cat looks 
he looks really delighted huh 
wango 
right into the water 
and there goes the cat back into the sewer

and who catches the cat 
that little boy does huh 
what kind of boots has he got 
well they are big cowboy boots 
i do not know why she angry at him nam 
does she seem to be angry at him 
oh i guess he let the cat go away 
and the cat got onto the police+officer head 
right 
he still does not want them to get him back in the baby carriage
	that is what i think 
what do you think

	angry but these two are happy 
they think they have done a nice thing do not they

and what happened here 
the branch broke 
see the tree branch broke and they came tumbling down 
my goodness now it is all changed around 
now the little boy is in the baby carriage is not he 
and the cat is walking behind 
and he looks tired out 
should we just finish 
we are almost to the end of the story 
should we just wait and see what happens at the end 
she goes inside right 
she tells him to wait a minute 
and she brings them all out some milk and cookies 
now she dressed up like a nurse is not she 
is that a good story 
that is a good idea 
let us fi that thing 
yeah it does 
but you have to try for a minute 
yeah 
that is right 
hmm 
where did this come from 
oh i know 
i think that that sets the car up 
so that if we get the tire out 
we could change that tire if we want 
you know what are you have to do 
you have to unscrew it first 
that is a boy 
look at that 
yeah almost 
that is a boy 
yeah 
it is 
you could do it with your fingers 
do just the screw part 
try lifting it up nam 
an see if it comes up 
not quite 
try doing just the screw part 
can you do just the screw part with your fingers 
that is a boy 
yeah 
it is hard work is not it 
you try doing it with just your fingers 
other way 
other way 
other way 
that is a boy 
i will bet you it comes out now 
there you go congratulations nam 
you did it 
that is fantastic 
now in order to fi it you know what we have to do 
take off one of these tires 
i think we needa use the screwdriver again 
there you go 
do you know what 
let us tip it over on it is side ok 
that would be an easier way 
now you can do it 
there you go nam 
yeah perfect 
look what came off the other side too 
you hear noise 
you did not hear anybody 
you are doing it right 
i think it needs maybe a little bit more screw first 
that is a boy 
good for you 
good for you 
you can lift it out of it try and just lift it out 
you did it 
that is terrific 
want to do the other side too 
did you know what i think nam 
i bet you could take the whole car apart 
there you go 
very nice work 
that is kind of fun 
yeah 
how about unscrewing this one 
do you know what then we could do 
we could take out this whole section here 
you do not want to 
oh ok 
what would you like to do 
now um ok so you want to put a wheel back on 
is that what you want to do 
what that 
goodness 
i wonder where that came from nam 
something i do not understand 
either place 
which one do you want him to sit at 
there you go 
well then you would better move him over a little bit huh 
you driving better over there 
you are right 
you are right in front 
you are right nam 
he does not fit very well to be for driving 
you are right nam 
it is not very well designed for that 
what in there 
the engine 
you bet you 
no that goes in the back part 
you know what i think you need for that 
what this 
can you take that part off 
the engine part 
you do not have to unless you want to 
so i guess you will not do that 
yeah you know what nam 
go at it from the front 
go go this way and then do it 
i think that will make it easier 
look you have to turn one way or the other way until it gives a
	little bit to see which way it goes 
there you go 
that is a boy 
yeah 
there you go 
yeah 
now you can do it with your fingers can not you 
just like the tire there it goes 
bravo nam 
yeah you take the whole thing off can not you 
you know what that means 
car can not run can it 
got no engine 
you know what that is for nam 
that means when you put the tire back on 
you can sc you sc use the screw and the screw screws into that
	thing and it stays in place 
want to try it and see if it works 
you want me to hold the tire on for you while you put the screw on
	
yeah 
try that 
here 
other way i think nam 
got to screw the other way 
yeah 
look 
see what happened 
that is what keeping the screw on 
but the man fell down 
which man fell down 
oh he sure did 
can you see him up straight again 
you know what 
these little places right here 
are where you are supposed to put the people 
and they do not fit in front of the right in front of the driver
	wheel if it were a real car you would put them in front of the
	driver wheel 
you are right 
so it can not move yeah 
what about that one 
should we do that one tool 
but you know what you have to check inside first 
why do not you open up and see if the bolt is there 
that little yellow piece 
oopie 
we are missing the little bolt 
how about if we put that one in that square little hole there 
i would say that is good 
cept it is got to fit in does not it 
does it fit 
good 
uhhuh 
now what are we missing 
you bet you 
yes 
that is a boy 
that is the right way 
you have got it 
we are fiers yeah do you remember the name for people who fi
	cars 
member in in Trucker nam 
who are the people who fi his truck for him 
do you remember

why do not you sit over there on the chair nam 
would you like to sit on my lap instead 
ok this is called The_great_cat_chase 
a wordless book 
oh my 
perhaps you and i can tell what going on 
what happening here

in a carriage 
right 
and she stops to pick some flowers and what happens 
what the kitty doing 
running away 
why he doing that 
afraid 
afraid of what nam 
well perhaps we can see 
and his mommy realizes suddenly  that he run away 
he hiding behind the tree 
he does not look afraid 
he looks like he playing a trick on his mommy 
well the mommy runs down the street saying 
nam help 
my kitty has run away 
and i do not know where he is what the police+officer say 
i do not know 
what do you think he says 
he says 
Madame may i help you 
see the police+officer is stopping traffic 
actually i think it is a little boy in a police+officer outfit 
and he telling another little boy on a tricycle to stop 
well the police+officer and the lady are talking about the kitty who
	run away and all of a sudden what do they see 
well tell me 
that is right 
and the police+officer says 
look there is is 
there your kitty 
and then what do you think happens nam 
down here on his knees 
well why do you think 
he saying to the kitty 
come here kitty 
come here kitty 
and the police+officer leans forward to quickly grab the kitty and the
	kitty runs away 
and what the lady saying to the police+officer 
she saying to him 
officer go rescue my cat 
and they follow the kitty 
but where the kitty going 
through a tunnel 
you know what this is 
it is a big water pipe 
big water pipe 
and now the kitty does not think this is funny anymore does he 
he does not look so happy 
i think he going to go in there to try to get away from the
	police+officer and his mommy 
what happens here 
what are they doing 
well what well what do you see them doing 
where are they going 
they are going in here 
yeah 
but the kitty already left the pipe and is up on top looking in
	ah ha 
what happens 
the police+officer comes all the way through the drain pipe and the
	kitty not there at all 
where is the kitty 
where do you see the kitty 
up on+top+of the pipe right 
and then 
the mommy comes through and says 
there he goes he running up the hill officer 
get my kitty 
but then you know what happens 
what 
see this lady 
she wearing a very heavy coat and she got stuck in the drain
	pipe 
see 
and the police+officer reached up to grab her to help her get out and
	pulled and before you knew it they were both falling in the water 
but then the cat who came close to watch jumped into the drain pipe
	
and the lady says 
officer there goes my cat 
please get him for me 
so they struggle back up into the drain pipe 
hmm 
i am trying to figure out what happens here 
ok this is  this is the other end 
they have turned the pipe around 
ok 
cash register 
we have already done that nam 
but you know what we can do 
we can look at that interesting car that is in the bo 
would you like to do that 
sure 
can you reach it 
why do not you take the bo down nam 
take then take the 
yes 
grab it back here too nam 
grab it back here so it will not drop 
that is it 
down on the floor ok let us go back over here with our chairs and
	i will put the bo down 
you like this kind of car do not you 
ok what shall we do 
mmhm 
oh what are those things 
do you have any idea 
pliers 
mmhm 
and what this 
is this what you are calling pliers 
well it is not really pliers 
it is called 
it is a wrench nam 
um well it looks like it is a jack 
you see 
and what this 
right 
but you know  something 
oh i see 
that is right 
well you have to keep turning nam 
the screw is in further than that 
that is a boy 
not quite 
would you like me to help 
good 
you did it 
yeah very good 
unscrew 
yes 
member what daddy told you about clockwise and counterclockwise 
perhaps it would be easier here if we turned it like this 
that is right 
that is called counterclockwise is not it 
yes you did 
almost 
little bit more 
good 
yes you did 
ok what else would you like to do 
the motor 
where is the motor 
really 
ah 
that is the trunk 
that is where the etra tire is kept 
where do you think the motor is if this is the trunk 
yeah 
here 
hmm you know what you could do if you wanted to 
you could pretend that this tire was flat and had a hole in it and
	that you have to put on a spare tire 
would you like to do that 
and then you could screw it back in 
do not want to do that 
ok 
nam 
some day if our car has a flat tire you and and i can fi it the
	way you are doing this 
you know that 
would you like to do that 
you would 
if you are big enough you can do it all yourself 
ah ha 
how many have you taken off nam 
that is right 
and you took one out of here right 
three 
right 
more 
what makes you think so 
yes you did 
mmhm 
what would you like to do 
there still a motor 
where do you think it is 
that is right 
try to figure it out nam 
we have some other tools you know 
here is a tool and here is a tool 
perhaps one of these could be used 
that one 
or this one 
all+right 
ah 
i think you are right 
you are right 
i think you are doing pretty well 
why do not you try 
that is a boy let us see 
you are doing very well 
mmhm 
what would you like to do 
well there are bumpers to take off 
these are called bumpers 
this is a bumper 
and this in back here is a bumper 
that is to protect the car in case it bumps into something 
why do you think so 
wonder if this would work 
set it would 
ah ha this would work too would not it 
you did it 
maybe you will be a car fier when you grow up nam 
what do you think 
well there another bumper 
and here are some things that you could maybe take apart 
hmm 
mmhm 
it came easily  did not it 
oh nam nam see it is still attached here 
you have one more 
yeah 
oop 
pick it up please 
now shall we put it back together 
i think you have to do two more things 
well that is called a bolt 
and there another one that you have to take out 
can you find it 
mmhm 
oh my 
that must have been the last one 
yeah 
ach 
do you think you can ever put that back together 
oh nam what do we do now 
gee 
what this 
would you like to try to put it back together 
well may i make a suggestion to you 
ok can you see these things 
these are 
these are bolts 
and in order for them to be turned tight and hold things you have to
	screw them in like this 
see 
what you did 
may i may i see this please 
what you did was to loosen like this until it fell out and things
	came apart 
but you have to use these as well 
and what that means is that they have to go here see 
see how that fits in there 
you see 
you did not you did not know that did you 
and then this goes in like that after the wheel is on 
so before we put on the hood what we should do is put these in
	place should not we 
here 
would you like to put a blue one in here 
that is where the bumper goes 
that is a boy 
now um you see these places 
yes 
yes that is ok 
i think that goes there 
and one goes here 
good 
and this one goes here 
and this one 
ok now there should be some yellow ones 
these are for the wheels 
they go on the inside for each wheel 
do you see some other places where they could go 
i do not think so nam 
where do you think 
it is for the wheels 
where do you think the wheels go 
where do the wheels go 
yes 
there one 
can you see another place where a wheel goes 
ok so where does this go now 
but on the inside 
on the inside 
here nam 
that is a boy 
and yes 
very good 
now let us see if we know how to put the wheels back on 
i think like this nam 
watch watch 
see 
see how i have that up 
and then you put in the bolt 
ok 
now this is turning clockwise is not it 
is there something wrong 
really 
well perhaps we should see if something is ah 
what have we done wrong 
hmm  perhaps try that now nam 
try it try it now nam 
i do not think that makes a difference 
do you know something 
i think we are doing something wrong 
ah 
i know what it is 
i know 
let us take it off 
see that hole there 
that is what it is 
now put 
yeah see 
the the wheel fits in there 
that is it 
now that is a boy 
now what do you think 
you have to put the bolt back through the wheel 
here here a bolt 
put it through the wheel 
yes 
now tighten it a little so it will stay 
that is it 
nam 
try 
when you when you screw something or unscrew it this should be
	straight 
not to the side 
like that 
straight up 
good 
very good 
but hold it straight up nam 
ok would you like to do another one 
ok 
do you think so 
i think so too 
but you need something else do not you 
yes you did 
what else should we do 
hi i am nam 
i am associated with the project hi nam

when she picking up the flowers the cat jumps out of the carriage
	
and 
she did not see what happened 
then she turned around and looked inside 
my goodness 
the cat gone 
she gets very upset 
she wonders where did the cat go and 
he hiding right behind the tree 
is that a little smile on his face 
he playing a game

but the lady very upset 
the girl dressed up like a mommy is very upset 
and 
she goes running down the street 
and 
what this 
there the police+officer 
he got his whistle 
he got his hand up 
and 
he stopping this little boy 
on his tricycle 
cause he directing traffic 
he got a little badge 
and

i do not think that is a real police+officer 
i think that is a boy dressed up as a police+officer 
is not that 
you know why i know 
cause he looks short just like that little boy on the tricycle 
and 
it looks like that suit is a little bit too big for him 
so 
the little girl comes up 
and 
she says 
oh my goodness

my little baby disappeared from my carriage 
what can i do

help me 
and 
the police+officer turns around 
and 
the cat shows up 
he says

and 
the cat still haves a little bitty smile cause he still playing a
	game

well 
i do not know why 
but 
he having fun 
everybody having fun pretending 
and 
the police+officer trys to go catch the cat 
and 
he dropped his whistle 
and 
he trips 
and 
he falls down

d
yeah

he got a nam on his shirt and cowboy boots 
that is funny 
so 
anyway 
they keep on chasing him 
and 
there the little boy police+officer 
and 
he chasing the cat 
and 
now the cat getting angry 
look at those eyes on that cat 
the cat getting angry 
he going into this 
what is that 
a tunnel 
i think that is a a big pipe 
i think he going to try to hide again 
look 
the police+officer chasing him 
the girl looking at what happening 
what that guy doing with his hands in his pockets 
is he helping 
how could he be helping if he got his hands in his pockets 
could you do me a favor 
when i read you a story 
you know what i am talking about 
ok 
so 
let us see what happens net 
this is a longer story than i thought it was 
what 
that is the one i think that may be the same one that bed at our
	house 
look 
they are looking at one end of the pipe 
and 
the police+officer sticks his head in 
and 
the little boy is sitting on the pipe and 
the mommy is looking at what the police+officer doing 
look 
the pipe goes through a little tiny hill and out the other side 
the cat already out 
and 
he poking his head down 
and 
he looks at the police+officer at the other side of the pipe 
that funny 
the police+officer comes out 
and 
he does not see anything 
and 
he falls 
kaplunk 
and 
the mommy comes throught the pipe 
but 
before she falls coming out of it she sees the cat 
look at that cat face now 
he still trying to run away 
and 
the police+officer is not very happy 
and 
the girl is not very happy 
so 
the police+officer helps the little girl down out of the pipe 
she about to step on her pearls 
look at that 
she going to step on those pearls 
so 
the police+officer helping her down 
and uh+oh 
she falls 
boom 
right on the police+officer and knocks him over again 
and 
his hat falls off 
and 
her hat falls off 
and 
look 
the cat coming back 
the cat coming back down to see what happened 
and 
they both fall 
they go splash 
it looks like there water there 
right 
see the little waves coming in 
and look 
the cat goes back into the pipe 
and they are all wet 
but 
they see the cat coming 
look 
her hat fell on his head 
is not that funny 
oh well 
so 
now they go up 
and 
they are going to chase the cat again 
and 
they chase him throught the pipe 
first the little girl goes in 
and 
now the little boy goes in 
and 
then look 
they get to the other end of the pipe 
and 
the second little boy has caught the cat 
and 
he about to give it back to them 
but the cat jumps up on the police+officer head 
and 
look at that 
and 
he scratching at him and pawing at him and tickling him 
just like that 
and 
he climbing all over him 
and 
the little police+officer can not do anything about it 
that is what happened 
and 
the mommy is angry at the little boy 
she pulling his ear 
i do not know why that is  
because the little boy put the cat on the police+officer head 
that was a silly thing to do 
and 
now the cat goes running up a tree 
and 
that little police+officer is really mad 
look at his face 
it is scratched now by the cat 
you would not like it if a cat went 
scratch scratch scratch 
is that like what nam does to you

i have never seen a yellow cat like that before 
so 
the police+officer is chasing up the cat the cat up the tree 
and 
the cat goes to another branch 
and 
the mommy is crying cause she thinks the cat is going to escape 
and 
the little boy is pointing up at what happening 
all of a sudden the police+officer finally catches the cat right behind
	the neck 
right like that 
d

not like you 
and 
look 
the boy who happy over here 
and 
now he sticking out his tongue 
and 
the the little girl who sad over here 
and 
now she smiling 
that is funny 
the girl gets happier 
but 
that branch is not big enough for everybody 
and 
the boy lost his balance 
an 
he dropped the cat 
and 
the mommy caught the cat 
but 
look

and 
down comes the police+officer 
kerplunk 
and 
he lands on the second little boy 
look 
the leaves are falling down 
and

	the branch to walk like a cane 
and 
here comes the cat and the police+officer and the mommy 
and

you should see the a the red light go when you pound 
i will just turn it off 
what do you want for breakfast 
toast 
who do you think what do you want daddy 
i do not care 
your original suggestion fine  
ok let us have toast 
put the newspaper away and have some toast 
why do not you put that book in your a basket 
you want to sit on it 
well all+right 
what are those noises you are doing nam 
d
putting up some water for coffee 
so mommy and daddy can have some coffee 
you you do not know where the classified ads section is 
i go through that newspaper  
yeah no i did not 
i did not have it 
nam might have done something  just stick it directly in the 
what nam 
ok 
i will do that since you asked so nicely 
she will 
oh boy oh boy 
pretty plants  
they do not live on their own 
i know you i know they do not 
i am trying to develop a new sense of responsibility 
oh yeah 
could daddy put a piece of toast in for nam 
sure 
let us see 
then we need some 
what are you going to want on your toast nam 
peanut freak 
peanut+butter 
peanut+butter and butter ok 
that is leftover from yesterday 
i think perhaps it will be a good idea if you ate it 
you can have peanut+butter and butter 
but i would like you to eat that while you are waiting 
did you put one piece in or two 
one 
because if you put one in you have to put it in this side not the
	other side nam 
oh i do not know why 
put it in 
why do you say that nam 
because there a thermostat 
and you burn up the toast if you just put it in the far side 
there a there a 
no i did not know that 
heats up to the mechanism 
fiing the toaster 
so it will not fall off 
so your father  
reading the newspaper

ok you take them out but let them cool off first 
do you know how hot they are 
they are very hot 
this machine is very hot 
you can burn your hand on that machine 
i can not touch it 
it is hot 
we will wait a minute until it cools down 
you know we use much less coffee 
mhmm 
this machine was a great investment 
ok nam 
take one out at a time 
very carefully 
do not touch the machine 
just touch the toast 
ok lift it up 
shall i put that book away for you 
ok 
leave it 
would you like me to put something on your toast for you

we are so proud of you for only going pee in the potty 
you have been dry for days and days now 
that is called butter

it is called peanut+butter without peanuts 
no peanuts in it 
because it is not peanut+butter 
i was pulling a hair out 
so i did not want you to get it in the butter 
you going to finish your breakfast 
because hair does not taste good 
it makes you feel funny when you get it in your mouth by mistake 
sometimes there some hair in your food 
and you eat the food 
and you get the hair in your mouth 
you would had that happen 
you do not like it 
you say echh nam ha a hair in my outh i have a air in my outh
	
ded it out 
it is what you say to me 
because it feels funny 
it feels really ucky 
well it does not hurt eactly 
but it feels sort of disgusting 
because it gags you 
because it triggers your gag refle 
triggers your tongue does it 
i know 
just like nam does 
nam you do not have to make funny faces you have already got one 
you just leave your face the way it is 
leave it the way it is 
we think it is very funny just the way it is 
oh that is even funnier 
does nam make funny faces 
i thought it was uh grandmother made funny faces 
how is grandmother 
and grandfather are they all+right 
you see what i mean 
what would he say 
if you do address a conversational remark to him he just
	completely 
i am reading the newspaper 
i already tuned out 
yeah they are ok 
nam is not in really good shape 
he too fat and has high blood pressure and 
is he retired 
no she retired 
oh has she 
just now 
i do not know why he did not retire  
oh i know why he did not 
i do not know why she did 
it is stupid to retire 
it is the damnst dumbest thing that ever happened to people 
well you did not like to retire 
you did not want to get up at si oclock in the morning and spend
	an hour having a shit so the rest of you get dressed 
nam i never said she retire 
i can not believe you said that 
well it is the reason she retired 
i can not imagine you just said that 
why does she have to take so long 
well she can not do it after she puts her clothes on 
so she has to get up early in the morning and crawl around in her
	underclothes 
oh i do not believe you are saying these things 
 feels the mood 
and it is on tape too 
it is on oh that is the worst 
oh my goodness 
i will uh wipe this out before i give to to my transcriber 
i hope you delete that little bit 
you will forget all about it 
i will swear my transcriber to eh 
nam has that 
she got all these tapes that she did of he mothers and kids 
but she spent long time 
you know nam 
yes 
talking to the mother and she was going through you know si love
	affairs and 
and got all she got it all on tape 
she sort of a history of her life 
and it is one reason she can not stand to go back and finish her
	thesis i guess she has to listen 
oh 
you drank it up so it does not go down the wrong hole 
good 
not nice when it goes down the wrong hole eh 
makes you cough 
because you get a little bit of liquid in your windpipe 
not not in your mouth 
it is ok to have it in your mouth but you must not have it down
	here in the part that is only supposed to have air 
in it 
where you breathe 
juice goes down what you in the air pipe and it is supposed to go
	down the juice pipe 
mhmm 
down to your tummy not down to your lungs 
because if you get juice in your lungs you will have pneumonia 
it carries germs 
and it hurts too 
hurts quite a+lot 
when it goes down the wrong hole 
and it makes you cough and cough 
it hurts a+lot 
d

i just wonder if they will let you do that 
oh they have them there 
you can rent them 
five dollars a week or something like that 
ok 
very inepensive 
those things you have they keep jumping around 
that is because we do not have any aerial 
the aerial fell off the roof and we did not have it put on again 
we do not want to but we do not want to buy a color television
	because nam stands so close to it to watch it and but i think
	we ought to get one with a good picture because it is for him 
it is tough enough to see the world that badly and then to see it
	double with a shadow and then zig_zag in it 
nam one of the most concentrated eaters 
puts his whole self into it does not he 
he chews on one bite and stares at the net 
very thorough 
we were we were going to rent him out for awhile 
every time we go visit kids people with kids around his age who
	do not eat very much 
boy after about three days they are sitting at the table like this
	shoveling it in shoveling it in 
really 
adjusting this all to the role model 
what coming out now 
your toes oh oh we will loosen this guy up too and we will give your
	toes room to breathe in there 
there is not that better 
yeah the heel is up by your  
and your toes are getting bent under 
there spread them out now spread them out and wiggle them around 
there that is better 
there there there you are there you go 
they are all loose and nice 
wiggle them 
you can wiggle them 
you can wiggle them 
that is waving them nam 
that is not wiggling them 
wiggling means going like this 
yeah 
can you do that with your toes 
sure you can 
no no nam just one foot still 
hold your foot still and just move your toes 
just move your toes up and down and around 
up and down 
down and around and around 
nam is into something called refleology 
somebody she met in when she and another friend of ours went to
	Florida together 
a woman works on the beat 
the connections of the toes and this is called refleology 
so nam bought the book 
and it is good 
it does limber you up and make you feel good 
your toes bent forward and backwards and sideways and under 
what happening 
no 
yeah my arms are not long enough 
it is still far away

all hung up 
in that building 
we you went in an airairplane that is right 
what kind of an airairplane did you go in 
an upstairs airairplane 
an oldfashioned upstairs airairplane 
that is the kind you flew in 
is that the kind we saw in the museum 
airairplanes what 
airairplanes go on floors no 
well because floors are inside buildings 
and airairplanes go outside 
they go on runways 
for a little ways 
in order until they take off 
and then they go in the sky 
they are too big to go in buildings 
mostly ecept for hangars 
but they go on runways 
and they go in the sky 
but they but they are not too big to go in special airairplane
	buildings like the air and space 
museum 
where we saw lots of airairplanes 
the what 
museum 
we saw the airairplane museum 
in Washington 
airairplane museum is in Washington 
where we saw the airairplanes hanging up in the inside the building 
and we saw helicopters that is right

that is eactly right 
and we saw movies of airairplanes

we saw it in the museum 
well because that was what they were showing 
remember the one the other museum 
remember the round museum 
with all the little with all the little sculptures in it 
you liked that one even better 
and the big pictures 
on the wall 
he was really much more absorbed in the nam than he was in
	the 
we went to the air and space museum for him because he is so
	obsessed with airairplanes 
ah he liked the other one much better 
it is all+gone 
you want your bread and butter or do you or you finished 
all+right you got it then 
yes

because when you were little you did not know how 
can you do it now 
who 
can you 
mm 
i still see something else 
and i do not hear it but i see it 
is it under 
have another bolt 
and another one 
is that it 
i do not hear anything 
i think you took it all apart 
do you need help 
oh 
ok 
good 
that is a cute question 
i do not know 
i think it goes in on the spare tire 
i think so 
that goes on the engine 
that goes on the steering+wheel 
mmhm 
that is not going to work 
screw 
i think you have to have a bolt on the back of it 
no you do not 
no you do not on this one 
uhuh 
maybe nam will play with the steering+wheel while you turn the
	screw 
ok you turn the screw 
the other way 
the other way 
whoop 
no 
let us try it again 
yeah 
that is it 
there 
can or can not 
mmhm 
uhuh 
that is the engine 
no 
goes on the um 
in the front 
no 
oh i am sorry 
that goes in the back 
the engine goes in the front 
no 
that is right 
nah that is not right 
the engine just goes right here 
does not have a wheel 
this is the engine 
no 
you saw a wheel in the back 
that is it 
good 
mmhm 
can i ask a question 
mmhm 
ok we have to write them after every step 
what 
after every step 
uhhuh 
you need a red screw nam 
yeah 
yeah 
that yellow one too small 
the other way 
you can use a screwdriver if you want to make it tight 
now it is tight 
now it is tight 
hmm 
that goes where it was 
m 
m 
um 
i think the tools go on the back 
i think this goes in the back 
i think so 
the jack 
i do not know 
here it is 
here it is 
mmhm 
well i guess you need the wooden sides on first i think 
i think so 
put the hood on 
yeah 
you have to put the hood on 
here before you put the sides on 
here it is 
mmhm 
that is right 
you want me to hold the car 
that is the wrong side 
nam said that is the wrong side 
no we need the other one 
this is a hard job is not it 
um no 
that one goes right there i think 
should we put a blue bolt in here too 
let us put the bolt in first 
ok 
you have to make these things fit those things in the holes i think
	
yeah 
there you go 
now you can screw it in 
now you can screw it 
there you go 
now you can screw it in 
now you can screw it 
right here 
ok 
that is good 
yeah 
nice and tight 
so ok 
now if you put the other wooden side on you can put the wheels on
	
mmhm 
we have to get this in the holes 
ok 
there 
all+right 
the yellow screw 
the blue bolt on the yellow screw 
mm 
i do not see one yellow screw 
good for you 
not talking about lumps here a blue bolt 
where the yellow screw 
do you see 
oh it is behind you nam 
there it is right there 
we have to fit the blue 
wait a minute 
take the screw out 
have to put the bolt on first 
ok 
that is probably tight enough 
little bit more 
ok 
very good 
it is nice and tight now 
now there the wheels and the headlights 
ok 
put the little bolt inside 
wait nam 
we have to put a bolt in first 
ok 
whoops 
oh i pulled my hair a little bit but it is all+right 
it did not hurt very much 
mmhm 
looking at the screw to see if it goes in the bolt ok and i do not
	think it does 
i think i have a bolt that is too small 
i do ok 
can you take the screw out again 
i am sorry 
i made a mistake 
ok 
now it should be ok 
mm 
it is working 
that is a good idea 
oh you did a good job so far 
it is a+lot of work 
i did not know you knew how to put it back together 
why does it have tools 
so that you can fi the  
so that you can take it apart and put it back together 
if you did not have the tools you could not unscrew the wheels if
	you did not have a screwdriver 
mmhm 
mmhm 
if you have a jack it is easier to change the tires 
mmhm 
you can take the bolts out 
mmhm 
mmhm 
it would be very hard to do it if you did not have on of those 
i think you probably could do it but it would hurt 
you could put the rest of the wheels on 
i do not know 
what is that 
a little car 
i do not know 
mmhm 
is this a tool 
is this a tool 
is this a tool 
hmm 
mmhm 
you want me to help you 
should we put a tire on 
ok 
you give that 
that is a bolt 
ok 
you look and watch the screw come through 
is it coming through yet 
ok 
ok 
should we put another one on now 
this one 
i see the screw coming through 
ok 
mmhm 
got one more huh 
i need another bolt though another yellow bolt 
yeah 
the screw coming through 
ok 
i see it coming through 
good 
now i think we are missing the headlights 
right here 
no 
that is the windshield 
mmhm 
it is supposed to be a window 
it is pretend window 
those are the headlights and the taillights 
the other one is behind you 
mmhm 
you have to put the screws in to make it look like headlights
	though 
mmhm 
i think it is a combination of the headlights and bumper i guess 
do you think we have to put some bolts in or not 
mmhm 
yeah 
we have to open the trunk 
oh there is a yellow one in there already 
i do not think the blue goes there 
that is right 
mmhm 
i will hold this on for you if you want and you put the screw in 
no no that is not going to work 
mmhm 
mmhm 
mmhm 
right 
i am sure we have to push it from the back 
yeah 
how about this uh taillight 
it already has a bolt 
that is right 
here your screw 
there another blue screw behind you 
let us see now 
it is almost done 
i am very surprised that you could do the whole thing 
because when you were a little bitty boy when you were just a little
	boy 
you could not put the car back together 
did you know that 
you need+to put a bolt in first 
it was just 
here it is 
time out 
you have to put the bolt in 
i see it coming maybe it is under your valentine 
there it is 
i see it coming 
see 
here it is 
whew 
very good 
that was good 
all finished 
congratulations 
you win first prize 
well i do not think we brought the other barrels 
what do you mean 
do you want to fi up all the rooms 
ok 
what what kind of things 
we did not bring all the furniture because we had to come so far 
you know we had to come a long way today 
so we did not bring all the furniture 
we can make we can fi each room 
because we had so far to come that is why we did not bring you then 
but we can fi up each room a little bit 
maybe the net time we come but we will not be coming tomorrow 
because we just are going to come one time this time instead of two
	times 
because it is so far 
it is a long trip 
i know but 
well we have to come on the bus 
before we used to just walk to your house from school 
mmhm 
mmhm 
because we live in nam and you still we still live in New_York
	and you live in New_Jersey 
mmhm

oh it is much too far 
yeah 
it is about an hour 
it takes about an hour 
that is right 
and then we can walk to our house from there 
ok 
let us see 
we could make this the living+room 
the whole family in the living+room 
and we could put this in the living+room 
this bench 
and maybe we could put one of these chests in the living+room too 
and we could even take some of the furniture from that house and
	put it in this on 
we could get the table and put it in here 
there only one table 
you know we could get that round one in there and there would be two
	tables 
why do not you put that one in this room 
so there will be one in each room instead of having all in the same
	room 
not big enough 
mm 
ok 
oh not too long

one of the interesting things about this with children of this age
	is that the mutual eclusiveness of the answers is not understood 
so that the the chance base is not fifty fifty 
i was wondering about that 
they quite freely will point to the same one for for both or to
	both at once or anything like that 
so you do not get that concept of of mutual eclusivity

the weather is beautiful in the country of the elephants 
they have all decided to go on a picnic 
suddenly nam looks up and eclaims 
look 
a rocket behind the palm trees 
i can see it 
it is going to land 
but nam only laughs at him 
come one nam you are only dreaming 
oh wait a minute 
you are right 
it is a real rocket 
it is coming towards us 
the rocket lands close beside them with a noise 
what going on 
suddenly a strong wind picks the elephants up like feathers and
	sucks them right into the cabin of the rocket 
the door closes before they have time to realize what is
	happening to them 
the rocket carries them off into space 
what is this doing 
yeah 
this thing is a um machine in the middle of the rocket and it hands
	them little biscuits and candy for them to eat 
nam and nam eat some biscuits held out to them by an
	automatic arm 
what an adventure 
moans nam 
the trip is long 
oh what is it doing here 
off what 
oh 
yeah he lost his shoe 
this maybe this airplanet is made of caramel 
you know what caramel is 
it is like candy 
it is very sticky 
look some of the inhabitants are approaching 
do you know what inhabitants are 
what 
they are the people who live there 
see them 
driven by some strange looking people a fleet of skimmer craft
	draw near the rocket 
what 
yeah they look just like elephants 
they look like shrunken up little elephants 
nam calls to nam come and see the inhabitants of this soft
	airplanet 
they look like elephants yet they are not elephants 
hmm 
what do you think they are 
long what 
right long trunks and long ears just like elephants 
the strange fellows invite nam and nam to get in net to
	them 
then they take them to some platforms where they moor their craft
	
net some flying eggs float down from the sky and the curly eared
	elephants seat themselves on small stools hung beneath 
quick said nam let us follow them 
these flying eggs rise high in the sky 
a city appears hanging in the air from enormous balloons 
lightly and silently it floats above the soft airplanet 
this airplanet is amazing is not it nam 
oh what is this nam 
you go up the ladders and you slide down 
why 
mm 
but what are these little eggs doing 
floating to do balloon 
oh i hope he does not pop them 
oh nam 
they land gently on a terrace 
the natives rush up to look at them 
one wearing a pointed hat approaches nam+and+makes an
	interminably long speech while another wearing a hat shaped like a
	mushroom smiles nearby 
of+course nam does not understand a word but he guesses that
	nam is inviting him to visit the town 
see they follow them and slide down the ladders and go into
	different places in the town 
yeah 
they come out of this little egg thing 
in the house belonging to Pointed Hat and Blue Mushroom there is
	a swimmingpool in the living+room 
truly says nam these elephants with curly ears know how to
	live 
nam has no desire to plunge into the pool 
she has found a friend a little dog with blue spots 
where that little dog nam 
does that look like a regular dog 
no it does not 
look what are those funny things on its head 
wrinkles 
that looks like it has four ears 
and what is this little guy doing 
but is not that kind of a funny looking jumping place 
oh yeah 
in the evening they are shown to their bedrooms 
these are little wall niches 
see they fit into the wall 
nam and nam are too big to fit into them so Blue Mushroom
	orders the pool emptied and filled with pillows 
mm does not that look comfortable 
every morning escorted by the little dog they all go to the
	breakfast fountain with Pointed Hat and Blue Mushroom 
this is an automatic fountain which serves cakes and soft drinks
	
nam what nam trying to do here 
why do not they fit him 
no i think they are too small 
his feet are too big for these shoes 
yeah well anyway he tries 
so then 
oh what happening today 
what 
that is right 
everyone has gathered in the grandstand to watch the contestants
	try to unseat each other so that they fall out down into the big
	elastic net 
so you mean nam was sitting in this egg and then this guy
	knocked him off 
why did he knock him off 
big whats 
oh handles 
oh hammers 
you think these things are hammers 
yeah they do have a little point at the end do not they 
something that looks like a hammer 
but they have a very long handle 
nam bounces so high that the bumps into his flying egg 
it does pop 
he bumps into it and one of the big red balloons rips 
oh nam 
so now the punctured balloon 
what happening to it 
what 
oh yeah that balloon is going to pop 
it already has a big rip in it 
and so all the people are rushing to get off this platform to get
	on a safer platform because this one tilting downwards right 
mhm

that balloon collapsed 
oh i think that there um that is air that comes out of there 
yeah they are making air come out 
ummhm

	the balloon 
well  what is he going to do

hmm why do you think they are mad 
oh yeah 
and he bumped into the balloon 
that is where he got the lump 
from bumping into the balloon 
the net 
but remember when he bumped into the egg

it might be better for you to return to earth 
i will be sorry

when night falls it is parting time but before leaving the soft
	airplanet nam receives a gift an adorable little blue puppy

nam daddy

are they really planning to sit in the uh back of the truck

because all the stuff piled real high boes way up to the top of
	the truck and beds and bookcases everywhere and rugs all rolled up
	and books and chairs on the top and if a little boy is inside and it
	should happen to all fall over he would be smashed flat 
so that is why you do not ride in the back of a moving truck 
because it gets 
i think the people will ride in the front and you will too 
when you drive yeah 
it will be closed when you drive 
hmm 
what 
also if there are not seatbelts he does not ride in it 
ummhm 
i agree 
because uh that is really when you are driving a truck um 
mhm 
and you are not used to driving a truck 
right 
stopping too soon and things like that 
if there no seatbelts then we can go along in our car 
for sure 
and he can be near the truck 
because nam and nam will not be able to ride in the truck if
	there no seatbelts 
you need some seatbelts 
i know you would rather go in the truck

did you ever stand by the window and feel the curtains move 
yeah and when you open the windows do the curtains move 
you can feel the wind but you do not see the wind 
because it is the same thing as the air it is the air moving and it is
	invisible can you see the air 
in that picture you can but see this is just the curtains moving

mm hmm 
because the wind blew it away 
yeah the wind will blow it away again then probly 
you are right that does look like the hat does not it 
still blowing away and this little kitty is watching all the
	leaves blow away 
because they are blowing in the wind 
summer breezes feel like hands touching you gently like this you
	see leafy branches of trees dance in the wind wind may bring rain
	clouds when the rain is over wind blows the clouds away and the sun
	comes out then the air smells clean and fresh 
hmm what is he doing 
what is he doing 
a fish 
that is a little leaf 
yeah i do not think there enough water in that pool to get a fish
	
i think that see it is just very shallow it is not deep see he only
	there his feet it is only about this deep that is not deep enough
	for fish see he just poking this with the stick because he wants
	to see 
what she doing 
what are those 
they are flowers 
they are just flowers and a little butterfly do you know what
	butterflies are 
they are kind of like moths ecept they are prettier they are all
	different colors 
and moths are just kind of 
well most moths are plain and most butterflies are pretty 
yeah she going to get it she in the kitchen what he doing 
huh 
he watching the clouds move 
do you ever watch the clouds move 
do you see pictures in them 
a mouth in the moon yeah 
up in the sky 
no the mouth in the moon does not say anything 
right it is just a picture on the moon 
it looks like a mouth 
oh the trees on the moon 
oh well there 
oh hmm 
can you see eyes too 
pretty soon it is going to what 
ah ohhoh 
you mean ok so where this boy that does not have a face 
oh you mean it is a head that somebody broke off with a saw 
and somebody and the mean you mean there a body just somewhere a
	little boy body and the moon is going to attach to it 
oh 
and so you think that the head is going to go back on 
when is that going to happen 
it happened last week 
did you see it 
oh 
oh 
oh 
oh i see hmm 
you can make a small breeze by yourself when you make air move
	you are making wind blow blow a piece of tissue across the table 
then blow a piece of cardboard which is easier to move 
what that thing 
that is a fan is not it 
which one is easier to move cardboard 
right tissue paper you know why 
why 
because it is lighter 
oh look at this the wind blew this whole tree down 
well i dunno 
little trees can bend with the wind but sometimes wind breaks
	branches of old large trees 
see that is what happened here there was a really strong wind 
and it just broke the branch off 
oh i hope he going to jump over it i mean it is lying right there if
	he walks up to it if he wants to go by this big branch he going to
	have to jump over it 
right 
that is true long stick things 
wind makes your hair move it can blow across your face or ruffle
	gently like a soft pat on your head 
why are the clothes blowing by 
well they are attached to the line with clothespins 
and then the wind makes them blow 
kleene 
yeah mommy was carrying five boes of kleene 
blow up a balloon let the air out slowly 
do you hear a funny noise 
blow it up again let it go 
does it make a different noise 
hmm do you know what these are 
what are these 
no these are pine trees just like those trees out there 
wind makes a soft sighing sound when it comes through pine trees
	wind whispers in the summer wind can make music 
can you whistle 
can you whistle nam 
oh this thing 
and it was all what 
a tuba you have played a tuba before 
how does not it go boopboopboopboopboo 
have you played a flute 
have you played a flute or a saophone or a clarinet 
you can play all three of those 
and you can play a drum too 
oh you mean a a a bulb on the end of it so you can hit the um drum
	with it 
hmm yeah that is true you do have to do that 
although actually you could hit a drum just with your hands too you
	know 
i mean that little drum you have you could just hit it with your
	hands 
what is that thing called 
oh just a plain drum 
oh i see 
a bulb 
oh who broke it 
it got broke when you were moving 
oh that is too bad 
oh 
oh that is really too bad 
oh you mean he mowing the grass so that when this roller comes
	across here it can go across the grass too 
i do not think so people do not usually  get rollers get these big
	steamrollers to go over their grass because it would kill the grass 
how come 
oh but this is his lawn still see this is not the street this is
	still his yard 
why is he mowing it 
because he wants his grass to be mowed 
yeah 
oh so well i do not understand you mean this blockade is up here
	this blocking thing is here to block the sit to block the street so
	that he can not go around here 
the steam roller can not 
oh so that the people can not go by 
why do not they want to let the people go by 
oh 
oh you mean you think that the people are going to be rolled over by
	the steamroller and flattened out like pancakes huh 
oh i see well 
some new holes 
where that 
oh you mean tar on the street 
oh these rollers come to put that bumpy tar stuff on the street 
so there would not be any more holes 
yeah well  people did not get squashed in it though did they 
right they are staying outta the way 
right well you know these steamrollers go very slowly so that they
	can watch out who going in front of them and they can always stop
	if they get are about to get run over 
wind brings the smell of fresh bread and doughnuts from the
	bakery shop 
they make doughnuts here 
you like doughnuts do not you 
what this thing 
oh it is 
is that why this guy has balloons 
because it is a circus 
you know there balloons at circuses 
it go break and go floating away but that is ok 
i mean you know what can you do 
right 
if it goes floating away that is just what happens do you want to get
	some balloons at the circus when you go with me 
you do not want to get balloons 
how come 
oh well you do not like to get them at the circus 
hmm do you like to get popcorn at the circus 
right and pop out and hit you right 
yeah so you put the cover on when you are making popcorn 
well that is good you know how to make popcorn 
do you make it very often 
when do you make it 
hmm 
ok 
animals can smell things that you cannot smell sometimes they can
	tell where men and other animals are watch a dog sniffing in the
	wind 
he seems to know when someone is near 
the rabbits are near and he can smell them 
wind brings your nose signals you cannot hear or see or feel 
this dog can smell these rabbits because their smell is going 
up to his nose by the wind 
yeah they are afraid because dogs try to hunt down rabbits yeah
	that is what dogs do to rabbits 
wind can help us work windmills can pump water from wells deep in
	the ground 
this is not a windmill but 
oh this is just a thing that tells which way the wind is coming
	from 
that is a little tail that also if the wind is coming from this
	direction it goes prr and pushes this little flag and then it goes
	like that and then you know that the wind is coming from that
	direction 
but if the wind is if that  the flag were right here and the wind
	was coming from over here it would go prr see 
that way you can tell which direction the wind is coming from north
	west south or east 
wind makes sailboats go the sail catches the wind 
it pushes the boat through the water if the wind does not blow
	hard enough or if it stops the boat will stop sometimes wind is too
	strong for small boats to go out in the water then men put up a red
	flag and the small boats must stay tied up to a dock in a safe
	harbor 
because it is too windy out and his boat can not go out see he only has
	a little boat and when it is too when the wind is too strong
	sometimes it could make it could blow away little boats it just y
	know it could blow them right down it is very dangerous 
so if the wind is very strong then you have to stay in if you have
	a little boat 
why is it tied to there 
well because so it will not blow away if you do not tie up a boat then
	it can just drift away into the water just like this 
yeah that is their own boat and they want to keep it 
see they are stuck because there no wind so their boat  will not
	go anywhere they will have to row it see they are rowing their boat 
row row row your boat do you remember that song 
can you sing it 
that is all you can remember 
gently down the stream 
life is but a dream 
the wind is blowing those trees see it is blowing down these
	branches too 
ok now you know the

suppose they had to go make a landing on that truck 
could that truck pick  up 
could they 
like if they were coming through the air

i was wondering if the truck could 
like 
if the truck could take them to the helicopter airport 
you know 
will they both fit in there 
it broke 
let us see if we can put it back 
did mine break too 
they all broke huh 
let us make something else and put it in the truck and let the
	truck 
take it to the uh to the yard or something

we do not have any more green ones 
maybe we can just use blue and yellow 
can we use blue and yellow 
oh do not we have any more red ones 
oh fiddlesticks

maybe we could just use blue 
or else we could just let it be like this and drive it over to 
the boat yard

they might want to read on the way 
ok 
now 
you show me how to go to the boat yard 
hhmm

d
so what love 
make sure that they are not going to have for us 
your spaghetti 
yeah i think so 
here 
oh thank+you 
mmm great 
just to make up for your hum 
light lunch 
it was not really light 
it was two roast beef sandwiches 
i was  
thing is i was  
pardon 
yes 
well anyway mommy had it so it was not wasted 
how about if we put your napkin in front of you so that you do not
	get your new jammie blanket all full of spaghetti 
well do you want it to be all full of spaghetti 
your first day of wearing your new jammie blanket 
there 
well that is one thing about spaghetti it always falls off 
did you have fun playing with nam today 
hmm it warmed up 
we had a+lot of melting 
yes i am beginning to see the grass in places 
really 
mmhm 
well it could not have melted that much 
well it is pulling where people have had their sidewalks plowed the
	snow pulling away and you can see grass in certain places 
hmm 
gee 
i did my long walk 
i got to good shoes 
my feet are really beginning to hurt 
my arches hurt 
mmm 
that is that is the one thing 
she recommends in  
that is right 
well nam in nam told me that there a store in
	Cambridge called the Run_a_tnam 
it sells ecellent shoes for joggers 
bing that i am walking briskly on A_M aerobics program i was
	thinking of going there 
mmhm 
think so 
got an estimate from Norstrom 
one thousand dollars if we do the work three thousand 
if he does the work 
d
is this the one you like 
no 
he was just very quiet 
i have a feeling 
one thousand instead of three hundred 
we  you had a three hundred bid did not you 
yeah right 
i think nam is going to get our 
did you laugh in his face 
no he 
what did he say 
no he sent me it in the mail 
mmm 
try this 
it was very well written up though 
i am sorry 
have another one 
did you describe anything to me about Norstrom 
no but he came in a suit and a tie 
very quiet did not say much of anything 
ll who is the guy who the guy you liked the best 
nam 
and i have not gotten his yet 
oh 
but i imagine his is going to be comparable 
mmm 
i just have this feeling 
i do not know nam seems to be more in our price range 
and what was his bid 
three hundred and si hundred 
yeah 
think he going to get the job 
what 
think i am going to get the job 
no 
you think he going to get the job 
well i mean if nam comes up with a two thousand for him to do
	all the work i think nam is going to get the job yeah 
i mean that is one thousand five hundred dollars difference 
maybe we can 
yeah we can just tell nam we want him to put up the new
	plaster board 
yeah well i i am sure that will increase it you know somewhat
	but 
how many total bids did you solicit 
si 
no ten 
ten or eleven 
oh 
how many total have you got to date 
nam my last one 
huh 
d
oh yeah 
know why 
cause you got some on your mouth and then it 
nam the only one out 
mmhm 
Norstrom and nam came the same day 
Norstrom 
ought to 
Norstrom 
ought to get nam tomorrow 
Norstrom is high 
he the highest so far 
there was another 
yes he is the highest so far because nam uh was my
	first one and he was the highest 
for him to do just the preparation cause i never asked him if he
	would do everything 
his was only 
his was 
i mean like maybe four hundred or five hundred 
uhhuh 
and that was the highest for preparation but um 
is the rule of thumb you know you double whatever their
	preparation is and you get their paying cost 
no i do not know what the rule of thumb is because i did not ask
	them all that question 
because it was not until i was half way through talking to these
	people that you decided that you decided that maybe it would be
	worth us asking them to do all the work 
how many uh people did you ask in all 
the last four 
now three of them have doubled it 
yeah 
last four two doubled it and one only gave me an estimate for
	when he did all the work and you never gave anything back from that
	called you called up and you answered 
mmm 
see that is why it would have been nice if you would taken me seriously
	when i first started talking 
hmm 
otherwise i could have had twelve estimates 
oh here there now  now 
it was not that i did not take you seriously 
d
it is just that i just did not think at the time about how
	unrealistic it would be for you to try to do the painting yourself 
that is cause i do not think that you got really into it 
that is true 
i did not get into it 
i wish you would gotten into it at the time when i started discussing
	it 
i think i made too much here 
we are not going to be eating all of this 
how are you doing nam 
well you eat as much as you can 
this is really nice 
you can go to nursery school tomorrow 
i thought we would not be able to 
why 
because we are not going to leave for New Jersey until after nursery
	school over 
cause daddy has some work until then five 
you can put up you can go and visit your auntie again and all those
	pretty clothes 
when you get dressed up when you are over there 
you would like me to stay there for a little bit 
you want me to be your auntie 
ok i i will stay a little bit 
i would like to walk too though 
ok 
but i will stay and we will play for a bit and then i will go and do my
	walking 
hmm 
you are full 
where did you get this jammie blanket 
did mommy and you go uh this afternoon 
mmm 
it is a size si 
d
for a si year old 
no kidding 
now that is twice as big and old as you 
i finally found out where nam is 
i drove past it on my way way to nam 
so i know where that store is now 
hhmm 
does she live in nam 
yeah 
oh eleven 
you have to pull them up like a skirt when you walk 
poor nam called today 
why is she poor 
well because she was thinking of enrolling nam 
oh 
and i told her she said 
i am i would like to come net week 
mmm 
to the nursery school and i 
said nam it is already enrolled for net year 
um 
petals 
petals 
mmm 
why does a flower  
i think that this is supposed to be where the pollen is 
and the petals are pretty colors that attract bees so they will come
	and make the nam 
well that is not a real flower 
so they can not 
you are right they can not 
but in a real flower from a real flower they could make nam 
because there no nectar in a pretend flower 
only in real flowers 
well cause that is just made out of straw or something 
it is not 
actually the bees make the nam in their bodys 
they just use the pollen to do it 
no 
is it pollen 
pollen and nectar 
listen we just read a book yesterday about bees making nam 
hmm 
they use pollen and nectar 
mmhm 
what is nectar 
Susandll show you 
d
mmhm 
nam knows all about the worker bees 
and the queen bee 
d
mmm 
yeah 
mmhm 
i 
flop flop flop flop 
flop flop and the  go  
are those their wings going flop flop flop 
flap 
flap flap flap 
and those are 
are those milkweed pods 
wait a minute what kind of weeds are those 
no that is clover 
clover 
right 
what a dummy i am 
but what about the nectar and the pollen 
that is the part i am interested in 
yes 
mmm 
hmm 
hmm 
that is right 
how come 
they work until they die 
those worker bees 
oh 
and most of their 
oh no this is real 
they really do this nam 
hmm 
but in reallife bees do lay eggs just like that 
the queen bees she 
only the queen bee lays eggs 
hmm 
your right 
hmm 
and these little things are the cells in the honeycomb 
where h bays the the bees mature 
hmm 
and they are coming out 
he coming out of a cell 
has he just been born 
how can you tell 
can you can tell from looking at him he a worker bee 
hmm 
they do not discuss that wit 
putting nam in it 
oh he collecting it from the hives 
what are they doing 
mmm 
well know an interesting thing is that bees do not fly at night time
	because they do not see and they come out to what the problem is and
	the skunks eat them 
oh really 
skunks eat bees 
yes 
they are very brave 
hey do not epect it either 
d
hmm 
d
d
thank+you 
you did a very good job of interpreting that for me nam 
maybe we can go over that again at coffee time 
would you like a little more spaghetti 
hmm 
that come in the mail today 
hmm 
ok aw i looked closely 
it looks to me like they are all consuming 
looks like they are at the check out counter of a supermarket and
	they are all buying things and that is what the people who make this
	newspaper would like us to do 
d
you are very handy with that chair

no 
really

d
oh i beg your pardon what an ogoo

otherwise i think we would be in the toilet 
hmm 
as a result 
actually we will probably go through that she four anyway 
hmm

	they are going to open it 
oh 
well why should we bring them a bottle of wine then

we i was going to try it on the  
i was thinking of making something

hmm 
well your hair will soon be long enough to do that 
it is hard to wait is not it nam 
reassuring 
sympathizing 
well i do not know 
i was actually listening about how hard it was 
i know 
oh 
i was i was the one who was reassuring 
yes 
yes 
well because he 
does he still wear them 
wet his diapers so much that he wet his pants 
d
and he could not go home in wet pants 
he would have gotten cold so we put those dry pants on him 
has nam 
and he took them home but he will bring them back the net time he
	comes to see us 
have you and nam had chicken po 
well i have had chicken po 
nam has not 
why 
she liable to get them now 
what 
you mean because of going to nursery school 
no 
because i was eposed to them today 
oh well no 
not because you were eposed to them but she has to be eposed to
	them 
that is right 
i would have to actually have it for her to get it from me 
yeah 
have you had chicken po 
yes 
d
d
as a little boy 
i am still not convinced it was chicken po 
it was nam in one of the class where i work 
and i he showed me this this little thing on his tummy 
it looked to me like a mole that he had scratched and irritated 
it was getting infected 
so we sent down to the nurse and she said it was chicken po 
i wonder if it was impetigo 
is it just one mark 
yeah 
is that right 
well that could happen 
you just get one mark and that is chicken po 
it is good for you 
you know that sort of thing 
you mean that is all you get 
yeah 
but anyhow that does happen to some people 
oh i have such a nice little girl up on my lap 
but that is hard to diagnose only on one mark 
it would be much easier to diagnose when you  at the stages 
d
what record do you have in mind 
careful you do not trip over that uh  spot over there nam 
i will make up your coffee 
all+right 
d
should i turn off the tape 
yeah  
yeah 
dinner over 
dinner is officially declared over now 
bong 
did you turn off the tape 
no 
turn it off  
well there are some fun things for us to do in here lovie 
should we start off with that story 
ok 
i think it is over in this bo here 
ok 
be glad to 
maybe you can slide it 
see if it will see if it will slide 
push 
that is it 
that is like the camera we have at home 
this is a story called 
The_great_cat_chase 
oh 
it is a nam book 
she the one who wrote the story you have about the the uh
	monsters 
you remember 
with the uh with the nam 
and the uh letter eating the letter eating 
i can not remember what it was 
it was a letter eating something 
remember that one 
well there is a lady taking her dog for a walk 
oh 
ecuse me 
yes 
her cat 
she taking her cat for a walk in a little carriage there 
tsk 
and she looks kind of bundled up does not she that pussy+cat 
are you comfortable 
she stops to uh pick up her roller skates 
actually she picking a flower 
and look what the cat does 
the cat jumps out of the carriage 
and she runs around and hides behind this tree 
and the lady is very very upset 
oh nam  she says 
oh nam 
where is that cat 
she so ecited she throws her arms up in the air 
and the flower goes a scooting off through the air 
she feeling very upset 
because her pussy+cat 
she prob 
maybe she calls it a baby just like you do 
her her her baby her pussy+cat is gone 
she does not know where she is 
i think that she a little girl just like you and that she is
	taking pretending she taking her baby for a walk 
and she using her pussy+cat for the baby 
tsk 
so then she runs down the street and there a little guy dressed
	up as a police+officer 
and she says 
oh 
oh 
oh 
my baby gone 
i do not know what happened 
maybe somebody kidnapped him 
he gone from the carriage 
the police+officer there holding up traffic 
clothes do not fit do they 
do they 
i think he probably her little brother or somebody else in the
	neighborhood pretending to be a police+officer 
and what the police+officer do 
mmm 
yeah 
what do you think he saying to the lady 
what do you think he says to her 
he says 
oh 
oh 
there there she is 
there your baby 
there your pussy+cat 
and the lady says 
oh 
i am sorry 
oh 
then you know what happens 
the police+officer goes down on his knees 
and he says 
here kitty kitty kitty kitty here kitty kitty kitty 
and he trying to get the kitty to come over 
and what happens 
what happens to them 
splat 
he reaching for the kitty and he trys to go and grab her and bunk
	
he falls over 
look at her face 
how does she look 
pardon 
she looks i think she looks kind of angry 
she saying 
look what you did 
you scared away my pussy+cat 
you go get him 
tsk 
so there they are following after the pussy+cat 
look at that look on the pussy+cat face 
how does he feel 
i think he saying to himself 
i am going to outfo them 
i am going to outpussy them 
they are not going to get me 
and he going he going in that pipe to hide 
he thinks it is a good place 
i reckon 
maybe he thinks they can not follow him in there 
tsk 
why 
perhaps perhaps he he thinks the pipe is too small for them to get
	in 
you think they will be able to follow him in there 
you do 
well we will see 
oh there they are trying to crawl in after the pussycat 
and look what happened on the other side 
the pussycat has come out and is sitting on+top+of the pipe 
looking back in to see if they are going to follow him through 
out he comes 
and there the pussycat up there 
look at that epression on the pussy face 
how do you think the pussy feels 
what would the pussy be saying there 
i will bet she would be saying 
ah  
they followed me out those people 
i will get away from them 
and zoom 
up the hill he runs 
and the little girl says 
oh 
there he goes 
there he goes 
up the hill 
up the hill 
up the hill 
quick 
quick 
after him 
get up there you police+officer 
go after that guy 
ugh  he says 
he  down there in the mud after crawling through 
and he still has not gotten the pussycat 
so she helps him up being a nice person 
tsk 
she gives him a little help onto his feet 
and the pussycat up there 
oh 
are you going to get me 
and kajump 
she falls down on+top+of him 
the pussycat thinks that is rather funny and comes galomping down
	the hill 
galomp 
galomp 
galomp 
oh nam 
they fell into the puddle 
tsk 
well i bet they they did not do it on purpose 
i can tell you that 
it was an accident 
they are going to be all wet now 
and the pussycat takes advantage of that moment to go back in the
	pipe 
and phoom 
to start running through 
there he goes  she says 
do you think they are ever going to catch that pussycat 
in she goes 
eck 
yug  says she 
all wet 
well he wet because he fell in the puddle 
so they go climbing through again 
and when they get to the other side what do you suppose they
	discover 
the little fella who been following are following them around
	since the very beginning of the story he has caught the pussycat as
	the pussy was coming out the other end of the pipe 
remember way back here in the beginning 
where he was just watching 
he was just watching there on his trike 
and he was joining with them saying 
oh 
when they were trying to catch the pussycat 
and when they 
here he is just watching 
aw shucks  he says 
this is not interesting 
he walking away 
and he 
but he does follow them 
mmm da 
hands in his pockets 
and he sits on+top+of the pipe and watches all this action when
	they climb through and come out the other side and fall down and get
	wet 
and he waiting back there so that when the pussy comes out he
	catches him 
grab 
he got him 
boy oh boy 
look at that 
think she will catch him 
well look who winded up in the carriage 
how about that 
heh heh 
look 
they are all tired and beat up 
the pussycat walking 
tsk 
oh 
she changed her clothes 
who is she now 
i think she a nurse 
i think she changed into a nurse clothes 
the end 
you like that story 
let us look around and see what else we can find to play with 
what do you see 
tsk 
yes 
it is a 
jeepers 
i do not know what the heck kind of flower that is 
it is not a uh 
i thought it was a tulip when i first saw it but it is sure not a
	tulip 
there something in here too 
mmm 
ok 
take the other stuff out too an see what you can do with it 
would you drive it over here lovie so i can see it too 
uhhuh 
what are they 
other parts of the equipment huh 
mmhm 
ok 
was that your brakes 
i think this is the jack for when they get stuck 
they have to change the tire 
they have to jack it up 
uhhuh 
hmm 
that is the jack 
we have to get that under the ale 
ah 
this is the a 
oo 
everybody can not can not see the ales 
how about that 
can not see the ales on this car 
the ale is the bar that holds the that the wheels spin on 
but it does have a screwdriver 
and i will bet the screwdriver would turn these things 
see if it does 
turn it 
oh 
it turns 
turn it the other way 
got it real tight that time 
maybe you can get the whole thing apart 
that is it 
yes 
it goes around that way 
yeah 
watch me turn it a few times 
this way and this way 
this way 
and you keep turning it 
and i will bet that will come right off that bumper 
ha 
what about the other one 
will it come off too 
hey 
you got it 
oop 
yeah 
that one  i think 
what a mechanic 
you got the bumper off 
that is the rear bumper 
is there anything else we can take off 
this thing 
try in 
you probably just have to turn the red part and not the yellow part
	
the hub and not the steering+wheel 
that is it 
just turn the hub 
you got it 
there the steering+wheel 
we are taking this whole car apart 
ha 
hey look 
d
you are going to take off the tire too 
that is tight 
let us see if i can get it started for you 
ugh 
you are taking off our tire 
oh 
is it flat 
oh 
i see 
what are you going to do 
i see 
but you took off our bumper too 
why would you do that 
tighten it up 
oh 
that is good 
i would not want to have any trouble with our bumper 
hardly anything worse than bumper trouble 
you really got that wheel off 
hey 
are you a mechanic 
you are not 
what are you 
a carpenter huh 
carpenters works with tools 
carpenters usually work on wood with their tools 
you are working on our car 
you must be a mechanic 
i think you have got that wheel about off too 
yes 
and you are doing very well with it too 
what coordination 
super 
hooray 
you got our wheel off 
oh no 
you are not going to take off the other one too 
our car will never roll again 
your daddy will 
this could be this could be a problem 
you take everything in the world apart 
and you get your daddy to put it all back together again 
this could definitely be a problem 
because you can take things apart just about faster than your daddy
	can put them your daddy can put them back together again 
it is a good thing you know how to put things back together too 
you do 
how do you do that 
what do you poke it with 
hmm 
well that would do it all+right 
mmhm 
mmhm 
mmhm 
almost do 
that will be your second wheel 
how many wheels does this car have anyway 
four or five 
count them and see 
oh you are fooling me 
how many does it really have 
how about this one 
oh 
you are fooling me 
you always skip that just to fool me 
you can probably turn it the rest of the way with your fingers 
when it gets loose you do not need the screwdriver anymore 
hmm 
it does look like it is jammed does not it 
oh 
it was right on the edge of coming off 
you did it 
yay 
you sure did 
i am worried about my car 
pretty soon my car will not have any wheels 
hmm 
could you turn the car around so we can see you 
mmm 
we can watch from here 
d
mmm 
what love 
sing about it 
sing about it 
oh 
ok 
once there was a little old girl gave the nuts a little old twirl 
um she knocked off all my tires she generated a great deal of ire
	in me 
cause i was worried 
i was worried worried about my wheels yes sire 
i was worried worried worried about my wheels 
ta to are you 
listen 
you are working on my fourth tire now 
how will this car ever go anywhere again 
you can not rely on your daddy all the time to fi the tires you know
	
he may have to go out and have lunch 
and then where will i be 
i hope you can help me put them back 
you did it 
you took off all my tires 
you know what this is 
it is a screw 
what this 
right 
now you are going to fi emnam
you know if you put the car back together again i will take you for
	a drive to the store 
let us do it 
let us put it back together 
mmm 
which one are you looking for 
the orange one 
oh 
i think that was the wrench 
it is in the back there 
there it is 
if that is the one you meant 
you are not ready to have that back yet huh 
sorry 
what will that wrench fit on anyway 
where does it fit 
ya going to tighten up something 
oh yeoh that was the one that was loose 
now that is much better 
you took them off when you took this bumper 
when you took off that bumper 
now that you fied it it is a good time to put it back 
you need these blue screws and the bumper here 
i will hold it 
you are a very neat worker the way you collect all your parts 
oh 
i did not see that 
that is what the wrench fits on 
that is the spare tire 
nd these ah these probably fit on here 
gee 
we could play with this for hours 
it is too bad we do not have more time with this toy 
we could do a+lot 
see if that nut fits on that 
this is a nut 
and it fits on this bolt 
hmm 
i told you this was a screw before but it is really a bolt 
a screw has a point 
and this is flat on the end 
uhhuh 
mmm 
yes 
they have a+lot of spare nuts in the back 
this is nice 
what could we do with these spare nuts 
oh 
this is what 
oh listen 
when this bolt 
this is the bolt that held the wheel on 
and it went into this nut 
that is what held it 
so you can change the nuts on this car 
you can take that nut in and put this nut in 
ya can interchange the nuts 
it is a nutty car 
d
uhhuh 
you are doing fine 
oh 
i think it is out nam 
you just need+to pull it 
now let us put that tire on one of the wheels now that we have taken
	the new tire 
which one would you like to put it on 
which place 
there 
ok 
all+right 
while you are doing that is it ok of i put one on this back wheel
	here 
ok 
d
that is a good girl 
all that turning for naught 
how yours going 
look under the hood 
oo it is got an engine 
look at that 
and more nuts 
these nuts hold on the front bumper 
how it going 
fine 
you can probably turn it with your fingers until the very end 
then you will need the screwdriver 
it is good eercise using the  screwdriver 
hi 
do not feel that you have to put that together again 
we can do that later if you do not to 
right 
ok 
cause it is getting 
we are sort of running out of time 
ok 
all+rightie

tsk 
well should we drive over to the store 
you put the people in 
and i will whip back on the wheels so we can make the trip 
mmhm 
oh 
you are right 
we do 
which nut do you want to use for the steering+wheel 
the red on or the blue one 
see which one fits 
try it out and see 
mmhm

hey 
put it in there and see what happens 
this big one does not fit through here 
mmhm

	a baby so it jumped out of the baby carriage 
when nam turned around her baby was gone 
and she said 
oh nam 
where has my baby gone 
and there her baby 
here the pussy+cat right behind a tree 
but nam does not know that 
and so she goes running down the street 
help 
help 
and there she sees her friend nam pretending he a police+officer 
and nam stops all the traffic and says 
i am a police+officer 
i can help you 
and  she says 
my baby 
he gone 
my pussy+cat 
she jumped out of the baby carriage 
and nam says 
she right behind you 
there she is 
see 
i told you i could help you find her 
and you can see nam very very happy 
now they have to get the pussy+cat back 
and nam sets down low and tries to creep along to get the um
	pussy+cat 
the pussy+cat 
what kind 
look at that face what do you think the pussy+cat saying 
you want me to tell you 
he saying 
i do not want to go back into that baby carriage 
sure enough just as nam reaches out to get the pussy+cat the
	pussy+cat runs away 
and nam is very upset and says 
you get my pussy+cat for me 
ah notice that this little fella here 
we will have to give him a name 
do you know his name 
we have nam 
should we name him nam 
ok that is nam 
nam thinks this is all very funny and first he getting kind of
	bored 
when nam was going to try and get the pussy+cat and the pussy+cat
	runs away he thinks it is pretty funny 
is it coming off a little bit 
ok 
yes he got a police+officer whistle so there is nam and
	nam tip oh tiptoeing along 
ok 
no there no spider in it i think we would get a little bit more
	out if you blow hard 
ah that is good 
does it hurt 
ok now the pussy+cat begins to go into a big tunnel here 
and here comes nam and nam following 
and nam just following along to see what happens 
there goes nam 
he jogs into the tunnel too to following the pussy+cat 
and see 
this tunnel goes through a big mound of the dirt 
and there the pussycat standing on+top+of the tunnel 
he gone out 
he walled through and climbed up on top 
and at the other end of the tunnel is a puddle of water 
i guess it is more than a puddle 
it must be a river 
hmm i wonder what happens net 
they all go in the tunnel 
poor nam falls in and gets wet 
and there nam saying 
there goes my pussy+cat 
hurry up and get her 
then here nam very surprised when he falls out 
here i think he getting angry with nam 
cause he trying his best and she yelling at him saying 
there goes my pussycat 
you go get him 
hmm he tries to help nam out and what happens 
look what happens 
she falls on+top+of him 
the pussy+cat thinks this is pretty funny 
there they all are 
they are sopping wet in the water 
and the pussy+cat jumps back into the tunnel 
so now what happens but nam and nam have to go back
	through the tunnel 
and look here 
here is nam sitting on the top and he catches the pussy+cat 
hah and the pussy+cat who really does not want to be caught jumps on
	top of nam head 
and nam saying 
get off of my head 
get off of my head 
and nam is saying something here to nam 
she saying 
you have to be gentle with my pussy+cat 
the pussy+cat gets off of nam face and starts running up the
	tree 
this pussy+cat is really trying very hard not to get caught 
he climbs up the tree and he jumps over to this branch 
now he does not have any place to go so nam reaches over and
	gets a hold of the cat and picks up the cat by the back of his neck
	
and that does not bother the pussy+cat 
cats do not mind being picked up that way 
oh i am sorry 
um and here nam ever so happy that nam got the cat 
but nam is not so ha happy any more cause he thought he was going
	to be able to get it 
just then what happens 
look there 
the branch begins to break and nam drops the pussycat right
	into the arms of nam 
now nam has the pussy+cat 
but poor nam has landed right on+top+of nam 
ah and look who ends up in the baby carriage 
not the pussy+cat but nam because poor nam landed on+top+of
	nam and look at poor nam

	has to use as his cane

that is it 
just put them right there 
come on by 
where are they going 
oh i get it that is like a car wash 
it is a car wash 
yeah it is an airport but it does look just like a car wash 
it does look like a car wash 
see this is the sprayer 
watch we will put it there and go pshshsht 
it sprays the car all wet 
pshshsht 
how do you get it over in where 
it only goes up to there does not it 
it does not go back in 
i do not know why 
maybe we will pretend there a little thing right there that shoots
	it out 
pshshsht 
so it shoots it back the other way 
er 
how come those guys do not get wet when they go through the car wash
	
or do they 
but they are just out there wauy out in the open 
like this 
if we went in uncle nam car through the car wash 
you know his convertable 
and we put the top down 
then we would be out in the open and we would get all wet and so would the
	inside of the car 
want to do that 
go through with the top down 
    ha ha ha 
they say spray soap on us 
we would go through and they would go pshshsht 
they you know what they would do 
then they would spray water at us 
pshshsht 
it would be like taking a shower in the car 
yeah 
we could do that in uncle nam car 
i do not think we better 
cause it would get our clothes all wet and also it would get the
	inside of uncle nam car all wet too 
even your car seat 
we could take our car and open up the sun roof 
then we would get everything all wet inside 
oh yeah 
then we would be out in the open 
then they would spray soap onus and get us all wet 
wet clothes 
boop zoop

who are we going to squirt with pee 
the car wash

i would say that is a little girl 
and she looks like she dressed up in her some of her mother
	clothes or something 
she got on high heels and a pockety book 
es that look like somebody i know 
who get likes to get dressed up 
i can not imagine 
somebody named nam 
she giving her kitty a lile ride in the carriage huh 
oh oh 
look what happened 
she bending over to pick a very pretty flower and the cat
	does not like the ride 
cats do not usually like to ride too well so he trying to run out
	of the carriage when she not looking 
she turns around and she goes 
oh no 
she sees the blanket on the ground and the cat gone 
course he knows where she is he peeking at her from behind the
	tree 
she runs off to get a police+officer because she can not find her cat 
she really kind of worried 
and she finds a police+officer 
and 
there a little body she oh 
i do not know she probably says 
oh nam oh nam my cat has run away and i can not find him 
the police+officer puts up his hand 
see he saying 
stop 
oop 
they turn+around and there the cat sitting right there looking
	at them 
they probably feel kind of foolish now cause they thought he was
	missing and he was not at all 
so they say 
here kitty kitty kitty 
kitty kitty 
cat does not want to be caught you know 
they do not like to be 
he looking at them as if to say 
well you catch me if you can 
and there 
whoop 
the police+officer trys to reach him and he can not 
he falls over 
the little boy laughing 
and the little girl very angry 
she kind of disgusted with him that he can not could not catch the
	cat 
so they are still calling him and they are walking after the cat to
	try to catch him 
an the cat looking back at them 
he going to go through this big pipe 
and he probably going to hide on them 
i would imagine 
oh no 
look at this 
he crawled into there and he going to make all of them crawl through
	there to catch him 
look at him 
he peeking in to see where they are 
oh is not that funny 
look at the man 
well it is really a boy dressed up 
but he going to fall onto the end an there water down there 
they are not going to like that too well 
he falls in the water and he helps the little girl out 
the cat in the meantime is watching 
he probably having a real ball watching them fall in 
oh no look at that he fell right in the h in head first into the
	water 
now 
now there he goes back in the pipe again 
oh they are so mad now 
oh no that was clever 
see the little boy 
he was sitting at the other end waiting and he got the kitty when
	he came out 
he lost him 
there he is hopping on that little boy head 
oh they must be furious with that cat huh 
now he going to climb the tree 
now they are going to have a great time getting him out of the tree 
he climbs up the tree 
the kitty hanging on by one limb grabs a hold of him 
whoops there goes the branch 
it is ready to crack 
oh oh 
there it goes snap 
he fallen down 
you think that is funny 
the man 
well the branch was not strong enough to hold him so he going to
	fall 
thud right on the ground 
well they are all kind of battered and bruised and they are tired of
	trying to find that cat 
there he 
look at him 
he walking along behind just as like nothing happened 
proud as can be 
no i think he kind of tired out so they put him in the carriage i
	guess 
i know he awfully tired 
look at him 
he ca he sitting down resting 
and the little girl 
i dunno what she up to 
oh she says 
wait a minute 
and she goes in the house and she comes out with some iced+tea and
	cookies 
oh 
she figures they need a little refreshment after trying to catch
	that kitty huh 
they all look rather happy do not they 
i think you know what we oughta do 
i think we oughta try an put this car back together again 
the way we found it

that is upside+down i think 
is not it 
let us see 
like that

that is just what the men do when they change a tire on a car 
what happened 
it is not going in right 
something in there 
you put it away 
see you might need it 
mmhm 
is it getting tight or not

	familys 
that is what some men do 
not your daddy but some daddys do 
this is getting to be

just a second 
move your fingers a minute 
now here 
get your screwdriver 
tighten it up 
that is right 
ih  you will not be able to do it with your fingers this time 
use that 
go ahead 
it is kind of hard angle for you to reach 
that is it 
right 
pretty good 
ok

that is the wheel

here 
this goes here

and that fits in 
and then you turn it 
wait a minute
